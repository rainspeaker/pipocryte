            "rendered_content": "<p>In the wake of a revolution that overturns everything, revolutionaries can only gradually recalibrate their sense of the possible. What was immutable has been swept away, and who knows what will be left standing when the riptides abate? Only time will tell which post-revolutionary measures will come to seem like final blows struck against dying institutions and which will be remembered, if at all, as tilting at windmills. The former leads to what, in retrospect, we call progress; the latter is revolutionary overreach.</p>\r\n<p>Revolutionary overreach occurs when the revolutionaries have stormed the palace but have yet to realize the limits of the palace&rsquo;s power. The institutions they most hate may prove resilient, and those they most want to introduce may fail to take root. It is no more possible to predict in advance which innovations will succeed than it is to predict what sort of state a revolution will leave in its wake.</p>\r\n<p>The attempts at de-Christianization that have followed the more ambitious left-wing revolutions of the past three centuries are common examples of revolutionary overreach. The first great de-Christianization was undertaken in the wake of the French Revolution; in the same spirit with which they abolished aristocratic privilege, the feudal organization of the </span><span class=\"c2 c4\">ancien r&eacute;gime</span><span class=\"c2\">, and as many royals as they could get their hands on, the revolutionaries declared an end to the religion that had shaped France for over a millennium and a half. Yet even before the Bourbon Restoration, the revolution&rsquo;s innovations in the field of religion&mdash;the Civil Constitution of the Clergy that had made priests employees of the state, the rechristening of cities named after saints, the cults of Reason and of the Supreme Being set up to replace Christianity, and the revolutionary calendar cleansed of the Gregorian calendar&rsquo;s Catholic associations&mdash;had largely failed to gain purchase and been swept away with few lasting effects. It could not have been otherwise, but the revolutionaries of the 1790s could not have known that.</p>\r\n<p>If the French Revolution provides the first examples of revolutionary overreach, the Russian Revolution may provide the greatest number. The Russia of Yeltsin and Putin, with its widespread Orthodoxy<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup>, its massive inequalities of wealth and status, its vicious, oligarchic brand of capitalism, and its venal materialism, is a bitter refutation of the Bolshevik project. But it didn&rsquo;t take 1991 to brush the ideological debris off the impassive face of the Russian populace. Even within the Soviet state&rsquo;s lifetime, many of its remakings were unmade. Economically, this began before the revolution&rsquo;s fourth birthday, when the fully state-controlled economy of War Communism gave way to the market-based New Economic Policy; private enterprise, it turned out, couldn&rsquo;t simply be abolished by sudden fiat. In the military, the election of officers and the abolition of ranks were ended by 1935; the USSR had concluded that the sort of professional army necessary for its defense couldn&rsquo;t function on an egalitarian basis after all. In foreign policy, the fervent internationalism and communist solidarity of the early Bolsheviks descended through Stalin&rsquo;s theory of Socialism in One Country, the schisms and splits that nearly brought about a Sino-Soviet War, and the Russification of ethnic minorities and constituent republics, leaving an official ideology of Russian nationalism different only in degree from that promulgated by the tsarist regime.</p>\r\n<p>These examples are drawn from the realm of statecraft, but equally striking Bolshevik overreaches are to be found elsewhere. Perhaps more than any successful revolution before it, the October Revolution aimed at a fundamental remaking of everyday private life. This included marriages and family life, which the early Soviets expected to be completely transformed as an inevitable byproduct of economic and political development towards communism.</p>\r\n<p>Prerevolutionary theorists of communism had various visions of the future of marriage and families in a communist society, but few devoted much attention to the subject. </span><span class=\"c6\"><a href=\"http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/index.htm\">The Communist Manifesto</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> (1848) brings up opponents&rsquo; claims that communism means &ldquo;abolition of the family&rdquo; and &ldquo;community of women [i.e., the holding of women in common]&rdquo; in order to mock them and highlight failings of bourgeois society, but its own position is left somewhat ambiguous. In </span><span class=\"c4 c6\"><a href=\"http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm\">The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> (1884), Engels holds that marriage will not fall along with capitalism, but instead will become truly free and equal for the first time. &ldquo;What will quite certainly disappear from monogamy are all the features stamped upon it through its origin in property relations,&rdquo; he writes. &ldquo;These are, in the first place, supremacy of the man, and, secondly, indissolubility.&rdquo; Our ability to predict the nature of post-revolutionary marriage is limited, but &ldquo;as sexual love is by its nature exclusive [&hellip;] the marriage based on sexual love is by its nature individual marriage.&rdquo; On the other hand, August Bebel, one of the founders of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, wrote in </span><span class=\"c6\"><a href=\"http://marxists.org/archive/bebel/1879/woman-socialism/index.htm\">&ldquo;Woman and Socialism&rdquo;</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> (1879) that in the socialist society of the future, a woman will be &ldquo;as free and unhampered as a man,&rdquo; which Bebel believed would lead to the end of formal marriage and an idyllic state of free love.</p>\r\n<p>One of the first Russian Marxists to devote close attention to the post-revolutionary status of marriage was Alexandra Kollontai, a prominent member of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party who organized female workers before her exile in 1908. In </span><span class=\"c6\"><a href=\"http://www.marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1909/social-basis.htm\">&ldquo;The Social Basis of the Woman Question&rdquo;</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> (1909), she predicted that &ldquo;the present compulsory form of marriage will be replaced by the free union of loving individuals,&rdquo; though she added that it was &ldquo;impossible to foretell what the relationships of the future, when the whole system has fundamentally been changed, will be like.&rdquo; She clearly anticipated a drastic change, though, since she also wrote that &ldquo;with the transfer of educative functions from the family to society, the last tie holding together the modern isolated family will be loosened.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Engels and Kollontai rightly felt that predicting the fate of marriage and families in a distant post-revolutionary utopia was next to impossible, and this must have been part of what kept other writers from speculating on the topic. But after the Bolshevik coup of November 1917, when for the first time Marxists found themselves at least nominally in control of a sovereign state, it was time to begin the work of imagining the communist republic.</p>\r\n<p>In 1920, Kollontai, now rising through the upper echelons of the Soviet government, published </span><span class=\"c6\"><a href=\"http://marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1920/communism-family.htm\">&ldquo;Communism and the Family&rdquo;</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> in Kommunistka, the monthly newspaper of the Women&rsquo;s Section of the party organization. This article begins with two questions which Kollontai takes to be on everyone&rsquo;s lips:</p><p class=\"c1 c14\"><span class=\"c2\">&ldquo;Will the family continue to exist under communism? Will the family remain in the same form? These questions are troubling many women of the working class and worrying their menfolk as well. Life is changing before our very eyes: old habits and customs are dying out, and the whole life of the proletarian family is developing in a way that is new and unfamiliar and, in the eyes of some, &lsquo;bizarre.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The reasoning Kollontai presents here is quite transparent: &ldquo;life is changing before our very eyes&rdquo; in all sorts of ways, and naturally men and women wonder if the family will undergo the same radical changes as the state and the economy. Unsurprisingly, Kollontai&rsquo;s answer is yes. In this article, as in much of her other writing, she outlines her dissatisfactions with the place of women in the Russia of her time. When the revolution upended the entire semifeudal world of tsarist Russia, Kollontai expected that the substantial social changes she&rsquo;d long hoped for could now come to pass.</p><p>These expected changes included:</p><ol class=\"c12\"><li class=\"c10\" value=\"1\"><span class=\"c2\">Socialization of child-rearing. No longer would women be oppressed by their duties as mothers&mdash;not because men would help out, but because &ldquo;society will feed and bring up the child.&rdquo; The state will establish maternity homes and day nurseries for infants, and communal &ldquo;playgrounds, gardens, homes, and other amenities where the child will spend the greater part of the day under the supervision of qualified educators.&rdquo; Not only would this free up women to work outside the home, it will also ensure that the child will grow up &ldquo;a conscious communist who recognizes the need for solidarity, comradeship, mutual help, and loyalty to the collective.&rdquo;</span></li><li class=\"c10\"><span class=\"c2\">Socialization of education. This includes free public schools, but also free lunches, free textbooks, and free warm clothing and shoes for schoolchildren.</span></li><li class=\"c10\"><span class=\"c2\">Socialization of housework. &ldquo;Instead of the working woman cleaning her flat, the communist society can arrange for men and women whose job it is to go round in the morning cleaning rooms.&rdquo; In addition to these social housekeepers, society will provide communal kitchens, central laundries, clothes-mending centers, and public restaurants&mdash;in fact, Kollontai cites the increasing number of restaurants in the great cities of Europe as proof that society is already moving towards socializing women&rsquo;s work.</span></li></ol>\r\n<p>So what, in Kollontai&rsquo;s view, will be the effects of these state interventions in the traditional domain of women&rsquo;s work? The family will be relieved of its remaining roles&mdash;as &ldquo;the primary economic unit of society and the supporter and educator of young children&rdquo;&mdash;and as a result will &ldquo;wither away&rdquo; like the state. As for marriage, as Kollontai writes in </span><span class=\"c6\"><a href=\"http://marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1921/theses-morality.htm\">&ldquo;Theses on Communist Morality in the Sphere of Marital Relations&rdquo;</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> (1921), &ldquo;once relations between the sexes cease to perform the economic and social function of the former family, they are no longer the concern of the workers&rsquo; collective.&rdquo; The state will extend no legal recognition to interpersonal relationships, even when it comes to establishing paternity: &ldquo;Fatherhood should not be established through marriage or a relationship of a material nature. The man should be able to choose whether or not to accept the role of fatherhood (i.e. the right which he shares equally with the mother to decide on a social system of education for the child, and the right, where this does not conflict with the interests of the collective, of intellectual contact with the child and the opportunity to influence its development).&rdquo; This is all that will remain of the parent-child relationship.</p><p>But what will the world look like without families? Kollontai described her vision of this future in </span><span class=\"c6\"><a href=\"http://marxists.org/archive/kollonta/1922/soon.htm\">&ldquo;Soon (In 48 Years&rsquo; Time)&rdquo;</a></span><span class=\"c2\"> (1922), a sketch of a utopian commune set in 1970: &ldquo;Life is organized so that people do not live in families but in groups, according to their ages. Children have their &lsquo;palaces,&rsquo; the young people their smaller homes; adults live together communally in the various ways that suit them, and the old people together in their &lsquo;houses.&rsquo;&rdquo; Here at last is the end of the path the October Revolution leads to, according to Kollontai, in which families are made obsolete by the state and marriage subsides into various sorts of unrecognized interpersonal relationships.</p><p>This was the revolutionary vision of post-revolutionary marriages and families, but what was the reality? At first the state did its part to facilitate the end of the old familial structures. Decrees and legal reforms between 1917 and 1926 removed many government restrictions on sex and relationships. Divorce became as simple as filling out a form and waiting three days. Couples were allowed to cohabitate and marry without informing the state. Abortion, although frowned upon, became freely available and free. The law recognized women&rsquo;s right to retain their surnames after marriage.</p><p>In the next decade, however, a reaction materialized at the highest levels of the party. The devastations of World War I, the Russian Civil War, and the famine of the early &lsquo;30s had prevented the population expansion required for massive industrialization, and the birth rate was actually declining. Meanwhile, the rate of abortions was increasing. The state felt increasing pressure to pursue natalist policies to combat the ongoing demographic disaster. Between 1936 and 1944, abortion was once again outlawed and criminalized, while childbearing was encouraged through subsidies. Divorce became significantly more difficult and expensive. Marriages were re-regulated and no longer legally recognized unless registered with the state. At the same time, medals and honorary orders were established to recognize mothers of five or more children, and pregnant women were allotted more maternity leave and supplementary food. Adult men and women with few or no children were subject to an extra tax.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout both periods, of liberalization and of reaction, families and marriage relations changed much less than the early Soviets had hoped, as historical records of women&rsquo;s daily lives demonstrate. For example, the diary of Galina Shtange, a housewife and organizer in the Stalinist era, shows the economic burdens of marriage that still prevented wives from achieving the independence Kollontai had predicted. In 1936, speaking of her married daughter Irina, Shtange writes, &ldquo;My poor little girl has to cook, clean, mend and fix things, wash dishes, and do all the other little things that have to be done around the house, earn enough to live on, and, most importantly, to develop as an artist, which is everything to her. She&rsquo;s exhausted and her nerves are worn ragged.&rdquo; Compare this to Kollontai&rsquo;s assertion that &ldquo;communism liberates woman from her domestic slavery and makes her life richer and happier.&rdquo; The housekeepers society was to have sent have not found their way to Irina&rsquo;s house, and she is as restricted by household labor as ever.</p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">But that was 1936, less than 20 years after the revolution; perhaps the far-reaching changes brought about by the advent of communism had not yet had the chance to radically alter the ancient if fading institution of marriage. On the contrary! In 1967, the New York Times sent a team of reporters and experts to the USSR to report on every facet of life in that country on the fiftieth anniversary of its revolution. In the resulting book, </span><span class=\"c2 c4\">The Soviet Union: The Fifty Years</span><span class=\"c2\">, the chapter on &ldquo;The Way People Live,&rdquo; written by women&rsquo;s news editor Charlotte Curtis, consistently argues that, after an interval of relative equality, Soviet wives have happily returned to an earlier mode of separation and dependence: &ldquo;Now that she has had a chance to think about it, she wants the man she loves to pursue her, marry her, and give her security, rather than to live with her in the old, casual, free way&hellip; [S]he is coming more and more to the view that maybe her place is in the home&mdash;for at least part of the time during her children&rsquo;s formative years&mdash;and that maybe part-time jobs are the answer.&rdquo; (Needless to say, Curtis&rsquo;s understanding of Soviet women&rsquo;s motivations is less important here than the facts she observed and recorded.)</p><p>Within the home, wives were still very much occupied with household tasks, as they had been since before the revolution. The promised housekeepers were available, but only to a select few, much like in pre-revolutionary society: &ldquo;If the Soviet woman has the money, and not many women do, she can afford household help.&rdquo; In the wake of a divorce, the mother was always granted custody of children unless &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a drunk or insane,&rdquo; according to a divorce court magistrate quoted in </span><span class=\"c2 c4\">The Soviet Union</span><span class=\"c2\">. The divorced father contributed a quarter to a half of his salary to child support.</p><p>Raising children had in fact become less burdensome. Soviet children could go to preschool at the age of three or even younger, although attendance was not compulsory and there was a monthly fee based on the parents&rsquo; salaries. If the parents worked late or simply had evening plans, the children could spend the night at the preschool&rsquo;s dormitory. The state provided a child-raising subsidy to parents, and higher education was free. Children, however, still lived with their families, not in age-based cohorts as Kollontai predicted, and the family&mdash;parents, child, and aged </span><span class=\"c2 c4\">babushka</span><span class=\"c2\"> helping out around the house&mdash;continued to be the basic unit of society.</p><p>As for marriage itself, Soviet society was still very much involved in it, despite Kollontai&rsquo;s predictions. Not only did the state recognize marriages, in 1959 &ldquo;solemn ceremonies&rdquo; were introduced in Leningrad and soon expanded throughout the country to serve the function of weddings, a religious event that had been largely discouraged since the revolution. These &ldquo;solemn ceremonies&rdquo; (so called in the USSR) were meant to seem more permanent (&ldquo;a far cry from the free love the state sanctioned during the 1920&rsquo;s,&rdquo; according to Curtis); they were only available to couples who had never been married before and, together with harsher divorce laws, were meant to encourage longer-lasting marriages. The couple was required to sign a certificate a month in advance at the Palace of Weddings and was granted access to special wedding shops.</p><p>Kollontai&rsquo;s vision had correctly anticipated the state&rsquo;s interest in regulating (specifically increasing) the rate of childbirth, but she believed this could be done without recognizing or privileging monogamous committed relationships. In fact, the state came to the conclusion that the age-old institution of marriage was an effective instrument for the production and care of children. Far from having outlived its usefulness, the family attained a heightened importance under a regime powerful enough to bend it to its own ends. And as an integral piece of the family structure, state-recognized marriage could not be jettisoned, regardless of Kollontai&rsquo;s argument that interpersonal relationships are &ldquo;no longer the concern of the workers&rsquo; collective.&rdquo;</p><p>Kollontai was wrong to think that fully collectivized society would have no use for marriage or families, but this was only part of her argument. Not only did she believe the family and marriage </span><span class=\"c2 c4\">should</span><span class=\"c2\"> wither away, she also believed they inevitably </span><span class=\"c2 c4\">would</span><span class=\"c2\"> when Soviet society eventually matured. It could be argued that had the Soviet Union followed a different socialist path&mdash;had one of the intraparty opposition groups, such as the Workers&rsquo; Opposition of which Kollontai was a part, triumphed over Stalin in the 1920s, for example&mdash;Kollontai&rsquo;s predictions might have been borne out. But in fact many of the economic and political factors she foresaw did come to pass: according to </span><span class=\"c2 c4\">The Soviet Union</span><span class=\"c2\">, &ldquo;ninety percent of the city women are believed to have jobs outside their homes.&rdquo; State childrearing subsidies and dormitories were provided, if not in age-sorted residential palaces, then at least to an extent that eased the family&rsquo;s role in supporting children. At least from 1944, any mother could choose to have her child brought up in a state-run institution and withdraw him or her whenever she wanted. &nbsp;And yet the family and relatively traditional marriages endured in Russia, and have endured to this day.</p><p>Why was Kollontai so mistaken about the fragility of marriage and families? A better question would be how she could have expected the disintegration of two of her society&rsquo;s oldest institutions to be so quick and easy that in 48 years no sign of them would remain. Only in the aftermath of the revolutionary year of 1917 would predictions of such extreme change have seemed not only achievable but even inevitable. One of the world&rsquo;s oldest dynasties, at the head of the world&rsquo;s largest state, had been overthrown by the world&rsquo;s most radical regime. The end of bourgeois marriage and the withering-away of the family were simply two more items on the Bolshevik to-do list, next to the rapid industrialization of Russia, the creation of a &ldquo;New Soviet man,&rdquo; the death of religion and superstition, the international spread of communism, and the transition to the first classless society in human history. Only later would it become clear which of these goals lay in the realm of the possible, and which were the products of revolutionary overreach.&nbsp;<img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\"><p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nIn 2010, according to the Russian polling firm VTsIOM, 75% of Russians identified as Orthodox, while only 8% identified as nonbelievers.

On the one hand: &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve only been dating for six months! And she&rsquo;s moving to </span><span class=\"c4\">Missouri </span><span class=\"c0\">for him?&rdquo; We&rsquo;re never entirely convinced of the wisdom of the enterprise. On the other hand, we have the sense that we may be left behind: we still don&rsquo;t own a blender, we&rsquo;re still skeptically considering online dating, and they&rsquo;ll be buying their first condo together soon. Other people getting married conjures the image of a gradually emptying dating pool which will in a few short years be full of balding heads and ticking clocks. We want to be saved from all this someday&mdash;from the string of &ldquo;relationships&rdquo; (such a formal word!), of affiliations more or less formative, contingent, joyous and unfortunate, but always undertaken in the light of their potential to end, always a bit less than the last word. We want to meet the person who will save us from this, and we are willing in principle to pay the price, to take our last first kiss. In principle, yes, but please, lord: not yet!</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">Suffice it to say that marriage leaves us in a bit of a fix.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">Oddly, a good deal of what produces this fix is the fact that all the really pressing reasons to get married have dried up over the past fifty years. One no longer needs marriage to have sex, to survive economically, or even to have children. Perhaps most surprisingly, one no longer needs marriage to lead a respectable upper-middle-class life. It has become possible to live alone. The social transformations which centuries ago began to allow us to choose whom to marry have at last presented us with a new choice: whether to marry at all.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">In such inauspicious circumstances one might have expected the whole institution to wither. What is left of marriage without the social taboos and economic imperatives which enforce it? There was a time when many answered: nothing. This was the promise of the sexual revolution, the idea that love could be pleasure without possession or eternity. It was what a thousand rightist jeremiads promised, too: that sex, freed from its age-old bondage, would destroy love, and society too. Some even thought they saw it happening: Allan Bloom said of his students in the late eighties that they &ldquo;do not experience love,&rdquo; that couples live together as roommates, &ldquo;with sex and utilities included in the rent.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">We can now say with little fear of contradiction that these people were wrong. The sexual revolution has bequeathed to us a vastly expanded repertoire of sexual positions without much changing the nature of love. Love still knows possession, love still dreams of permanence. And one way or another, more or less, we still fall in love. The ubiquity of couples, of long-term monogamous relationships, and the degree to which they orient our lives, is proof enough of that. The question of whom to love, how much to love them, and for how long remains the weightiest question of our private lives. And so, although the question of marriage has changed, we are by no means done with marriage. But why? Why does marriage, despite everything&mdash;despite our profound skepticism, despite the oft-quoted divorce statistics&mdash;continue to insist?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">Negatively speaking, we can say: marriage offers a dilemma. To get married is to guarantee adulthood at the cost of childhood; wanting to grow old with someone means you&rsquo;re already too old. Hence the tremendous anxiety around this decision, that in it which inspires flight: to get married means to agree that what one has is enough&mdash;and maybe that means giving up on oneself. &ldquo;Monogamy,&rdquo; Adam Phillips says, &ldquo;is the difference between making a promise and being promising.&rdquo; Are we ready to cease to be promising? And first of all to ourselves?</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">But the other road has its terrors, too&mdash;and we know these terrors better. It is a frightful thing to be always only promising. Between misremembered childhood and what we imagine to be maturity, the pervasive threat of unreality looms: one reads, writes, dates, fucks, and all of it melts into air, &ldquo;experience&rdquo; in preparation for nothing, perhaps mere self-indulgence. A career provides a certain grounding, but it&rsquo;s not enough by itself; making good art might solve the problem, but after all it&rsquo;s hardly likely. The figure of the middle-aged bachelor&mdash;his engrossing hobbies, his self-satisfied opinions, his empty apartment and empty bed&mdash;can only arouse pity. (And of course for women it&rsquo;s even worse.) Marriage may be no more than a </span><span class=\"c4\">folie &agrave; deux, </span><span class=\"c0\">but at least you&rsquo;re in it together. Many of us have been driven by the sorry spectacle of our parents&rsquo; marriages to speak bravely of the prospects of solitude; whether we can match this bravery in practice remains to be seen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">So, negatively speaking: we don&rsquo;t know whether we&rsquo;ll stay single because we lack the courage to marry or marry because we lack the courage to be alone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">Are we then doomed to make the major decision of our lives backward&mdash;edging slowly away from the anxious unknown? In another way we are extraordinarily clear-eyed. By the time we marry, if we marry, most of us will have a solid decade of serial monogamy under our belts. We will know the difference between love and lust, and the difference between love and comfort. We will know the onset of the first passion and the way it fades. We will know how much selfishness and how much hatred there can be in love, and we will know that this need not be disastrous. We will know the specific gravity of sex and the strange equations of compatibility. We will know the difference between argument as necessary hygiene and argument as beginning of the end. We will be spared the breathtaking na&iuml;vet&eacute; with which the heroines of nineteenth-century novels took the plunge. We will be wiser than that.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">Just as important: we will know more about being alone&mdash;not only in the desperate loneliness of the adolescent but in the richer, freer solitude of the adult. We will know the tremendous relief that a breakup can be, the degree to which coupleness is constraining, and we will understand that aloneness can be chosen.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">Perhaps best of all, we will know some of the contours of the intimate relationship between together and alone. We will know that the merging of souls is a myth&mdash;that within every relationship, solitude persists, not only as residue but as potential. And we will know a few of the thousand shades of sociality between being together and dying alone. Our forefathers&rsquo; sentimental education proceeded along the old arc from passion to disillusionment; ours will go farther.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">The two forces which have always sustained marriage, sexual love and the threat of death, have not disappeared, nor will they. But the old obligatory forms which guided men and women in these regions have lost much of their binding force. We might cling to these forms, of course, and no one can fault our prudence: these are dangerous waters. But we might have the opportunity, and we will have the time, to do something better. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></span></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">When Rousseau was just a teenager, he dearly loved his caretaker, Madame de Warens. I mean </span><span class=\"c0\">dearly</span><span class=\"c1\">. When she wasn&#39;t around he kissed her sheet and curtains and the floor on which she walked, trying to recapture the essence of her missing person. He couldn&rsquo;t tolerate her houseguests, jealous of the time that the two of them could have spent alone. And one day, when they were having dinner, he told a lover&#39;s lie.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">&quot;I saw a hair in that!&quot; he yelled after she put a morsel of food in her mouth.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">Madame de Warens spit it out.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">Rousseau promptly seized it and ate it up.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">Now, if that&#39;s not love, I don&#39;t know what is. I don&#39;t think Rousseau&#39;s desires are abnormal. What is it that we want from the people we love? Not just knowing they love us back, frankly. But not just being around them, either. And obviously not just sex. No: what we really want is to eat the person.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">Since, alas, we can&#39;t, we have to find some other way of getting hold of the person&#39;s essence. We have to compromise with our desire by channeling it down some unnatural path or other. This is not easy to do. It is </span><span class=\"c0\">very confusing </span><span class=\"c1\">to want something. Even if we understand our enormous, vague sentiment as </span><span class=\"c0\">wanting</span><span class=\"c1\">, and as wanting </span><span class=\"c0\">that object</span><span class=\"c1\">, and as wanting to </span><span class=\"c0\">have </span><span class=\"c1\">that object, what is it, to &quot;have&quot; an object? What does our wanting want us to </span><span class=\"c0\">do</span><span class=\"c1\">?</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">The market economy helps us ignore our confusions on a day-to-day basis. When we want an object, there&#39;s a protocol: pay for it. After that we can stick it in a drawer and forget about it, totally assured that it is ours.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">Desire directs us toward the object. But we forget what to do with desire as soon as we get too close, close enough that we have to define what &quot;having&quot; is. When we travel abroad, when we get to the country, when we come upon its prettiest cathedral, we don&#39;t know what to do. So we take pictures. We plan to look at the pictures later, when we&#39;re far enough away to feel normal desire again. We remind ourselves of being far away in order to help us enjoy what&#39;s right in front of us.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">The very things that we imagine bring us closer to our objects actually just put us at a comfortable distance from them. That&#39;s clear for throwing money at them or snapping pictures of them or making a mental note to tell our &quot;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQlIhraqL7o\">still counts!</a>&quot; buddies about them. But that&#39;s also the case with telling ourselves we &quot;want&quot; them or we &quot;love&quot; them or that they are &quot;good people&quot; or &quot;really sexy&quot; or anything at all. All of these interpretations unify our feelings in a way we can handle. All of these interpretations are masks. In reality, we have no idea what we want or why we want it and we have no idea how to get it. But I don&#39;t mean any of this to sound pessimistic, necessarily. I actually think that interpreting your feelings toward a person as </span><span class=\"c0\">romantic </span><span class=\"c1\">feelings can be beautiful and progressive.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">It&#39;s true: &quot;I love&quot; is just another mask. But the wonderful thing about the LOVE mask in particular is that it admits of some further experimentation. It doesn&#39;t just stick the person in the drawer. We know (some of the time) that we don&#39;t quite know what we want, and we try various new things--going out to dinner, getting married, exchanging fluids, squeezing the person so hard that you might meld together. I once saw two people on a coffee shop couch </span><span class=\"c0\">just staring at each other</span><span class=\"c1\"> for solidly fifteen minutes. How cute is that!</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">And the advantage of reciprocity is that your experiments are sort-of-kind-of endorsed by your object. Relationships don&#39;t have as stringent an etiquette as friendships. Imagine talking to your friends without the euphemisms &quot;let&#39;s chill,&quot; &quot;let&#39;s hang out,&quot; &quot;let&#39;s do nothing.&quot; Could you really ever say to your friend, &quot;Let&#39;s just be in each other&#39;s presence, okay. We will soak every bit of enjoyment out of each other that we can&quot;? Or creepier still, &quot;Let&#39;s make an </span><span class=\"c0\">oath </span><span class=\"c1\">to be together </span><span class=\"c0\">forever</span><span class=\"c1\">!&quot; Your friends would freak out&mdash;I guarantee it. But these desperate, impossible experiments are what dating is for.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">That&#39;s why romance is totally awesome.&nbsp;<img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></span></p>",

At his most heroic, Pierro&#39;s lover struggles to be true to his love (I mean his emotion, not his girlfriend) and he can have some degree of success provided that the girlfriend consents by &quot;endorsing&quot; his &quot;experiments.&quot; Even if I were charmed by Pierro&#39;s sugary sweet examples of this success, such as &quot;squeezing each other so hard you might meld together&quot;&mdash;and I&#39;m not: I find them nauseating, stagnant, and dripping with death, far too kitschy to represent a continual return to the newness of desire as Pierro seems to hope&mdash;I could never build a concept of romance around them, because there&rsquo;s only one subject in this story. Pierro&#39;s portrayal of romance loses the other person. </span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c1\">Megan Boyle&#39;s short story, &quot;</span><span class=\"c7\"><a href=\"http://muumuuhouse.com/mb.fiction2.html\">Clams</a></span><span class=\"c1\">,&quot; reveals what Pierro&#39;s portrayal misses. Not all lovers have the pleasure of asking Pierro&#39;s &quot;very confusing&quot; question, &quot;What do I want from the object I want?&quot; This dilemma is the privilege of an autonomous subject; &quot;Clams&quot; is about what the rest of us face.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I feel really shitty right now. I feel like a piece of shit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c1\">It&#39;s the story of a failure of humanity. Or to be more specific, it&#39;s the story of a &ldquo;piece of shit&rdquo; who has the misfortune of meeting another. The first is a girl who wonders what everyone else&#39;s opinion is all the time, well in advance of figuring out her own. The other piece of shit is exactly the kind of boy the first piece of shit would be attracted to, an uncannily direct boy whose tactless honesty continually evokes her own shame for not knowing where the world ends and she begins. In the beginning of the story she&#39;s drunk enough to persuade him to dance and in her right mind enough to notice that kissing him makes her feel &quot;like she has swallowed a small, energetic frog.&quot; But after flying back home (1.5 days after meeting him) and getting into the habit of sending daily cross-country texts and emails, she completely loses her bearings:</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">Anne has small superstitions which she uses to dispel anxieties. For instance, if she can make it to the fourth stain on the carpet by the time the elevator door closes, that means Nate has thought positively about her today, and there is a future where they know each other. It becomes a one-sided competition when a negative consequence is imagined: if she cannot touch two different kinds of tile with her feet by the time the toilet flushes, that means she said something crucially &#39;wrong&#39; in an email, and Nate will never contact her again. She doesn&#39;t keep track of which side is winning.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">There remains no vestige within her of the remotest possibility of determining what she wants from the object she wants&mdash;the poor girl is much too thoroughly caught up in determining whether </span><span class=\"c1 c4\">it </span><span class=\"c1\">wants </span><span class=\"c1 c4\">her</span><span class=\"c1\">. She notices that her feelings for it seem &quot;logically unjustifiable,&quot; but this information is not particularly relevant to her course of life. When they finally reunite and talk it is clear that she has sacrificed any personhood she may once have had in this asshole&#39;s name. When she can&#39;t even manage to make eye contact, he says,</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">&quot;It seems like you really like me.&quot;</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">Anne feels exposed and vulnerable and desperately wants to convey the opposite, but knows that Nate will feel alienated if she is any way but honest. She wants to run into her closet and scream the word &quot;confidence.&quot;</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">&quot;I like you, I mean, sure, I. Don&#39;t you like me?&quot;</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">&quot;Yes, I like you.&quot;</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">&quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">Nate looks at Anne and moves his eyebrows together.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">&quot;It seems like it really matters what I think of you.&quot;</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">&quot;Well. I think I worry about what everyone thinks of me. I think it matters what a lot of people think about me. It matters what you think about me, yeah.&quot;</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">Nate exhales and looks in the opposite direction. Anne thinks he has looked in the opposite direction so he can roll his eyes at her without her knowing. She thinks of every word for &quot;god&quot; and &quot;shit&quot; she knows.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">Of course she can&#39;t be direct with him the way he wants&mdash;that would entail confessing that, at that moment, he is the beginning and end of her speech. This boy has become the bearer of honesty and truth, thereby standing as someone she wants to be like and someone with the right to judge her. As such he is both her greatest hope and her greatest shame. That is why her attachment escalated while he was far enough away to let her escape her immediate surroundings by inconsequentially hoping for him. That&#39;s why she saw in him the objective gaze that could determine the reality of her being, which she was unable or unwilling to do for herself. Now I&rsquo;d like to say that if women are inclined to be socially defined, so much the worse for autonomy and self-realization. But the trouble with handing someone else the right to interpret your reality is that there&#39;s a fair chance he might do it brutally.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">After they have sex that night, it is completely dark in Anne&#39;s apartment. Nate rolls over and doesn&#39;t say anything.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">&quot;What, what are you thinking right now,&quot; Anne says.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">&quot;I was thinking... I don&#39;t have feelings for you, I don&#39;t feel emotionally attached to you, I just had sex with you.&quot;</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">Nate, alas, has good qualities too, among them the attentiveness with which he hunts down his own thoughts and stances, and the noblemindedness of his honesty, which he calls &quot;the only thing that will lead to significant experiences.&quot; And yet somehow we end with a blatant failure of ethics. It&rsquo;s tempting to try to dismiss it as something that can only happen to small, pathetic people. Or as the kind of thing that occurs so frequently, it couldn&rsquo;t possibly deserve attention. But we have to recognize that something actually really shitty happened here&mdash;and that an ardent commitment to following one&#39;s own desires to their most fulfilling ends, a commitment that I think Nate and Cat Pierro share, does not automatically transform romance into something that&#39;s all fun and games. In fact, it fosters negligence of the needs, vulnerabilities, and pains of the other. &quot;Clams&quot; does an immense service, I think, by exposing these pains in their nakedness and refusing to let us ignore them.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">Anne drives for a long time, intermittently lighting cigarettes. She wants to have an interesting conversation with Nate. She considers several topics and decides that attempting conversation would show defeat in some way. She is strong. She does not need to talk. She wants Nate to know that she is having fascinating private thoughts that he could know if he asked her a question, any question. She directs the thought &quot;ask a question ask a question ask a question&quot; out of the right side of her head. It is too quiet. She needs to say something. Her throat tries to say something before her brain can think of something to say. She chokes a little, and swallows.</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c1\">&quot;I&#39;m really tired,&quot; she says.</span></p><p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">In contrast to this trauma Pierro&#39;s romantic experiments actually look appealing. Anne needs someone to hug her&mdash;impossibly tightly, possibly forever.&nbsp;<img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></span></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c1\">Oscar Wilde writes in the Preface to </span><span class=\"c4\">The Picture of Dorian Gray</span><span class=\"c1\">:</span></p><p class=\"c3\">There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well-written, or badly written. That is all.</p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c1\">I disagree. The mistake that leads to this false conclusion is conceiving the effect of an artwork too narrowly: Wilde only sees the beauty that overtakes the viewer while viewing the artwork. That is one effect of art, but a work of art can have effects on the viewer&rsquo;s life (how he or she thinks, feels, acts, judges) that extend beyond the moments spent viewing the work. Wilde writes in the same preface, &ldquo;No artist desires to prove anything.&rdquo; It may be true that art, which can after all portray particular people, things, stories, cannot prove any general truths. But there are ways of influencing people morally that don&rsquo;t depend on rational persuasion.</span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c1\">How can art be a source of moral education&ndash;or of moral corruption? I mean &ldquo;art&rdquo; broadly, encompassing works of culture or entertainment in a variety of media. Humans learn by example, and artworks portray people acting in certain ways. Simply seeing certain actions can make those actions seem like legitimate options for us. If the people doing them are in some way already admirable or likable, we are more likely to see those actions as good or permissible. </span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c1\">Another way an artwork can promote or discourage certain actions or traits is by showing them rewarded or punished. The hero gets the princess in the end. In &ldquo;Snakes on a Plane,&rdquo; a couple disables the lavatory smoke detector in order to smoke a joint and have sex, but they become some of the movie&rsquo;s earliest casualties when deadly snakes crawl in through the hole where the smoke detector was previously attached. Similarly we can laugh or feel satisfied in countless other horror or action movies where the character guilty of some recognized sin or vice (cowardice, greed, betraying one&rsquo;s companions, fornicating, or just being overweight) is injured or killed.</span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c1\">But this is not quite the sort of moral influence I am thinking of. The kind of moral influence I am interested in relies on the emotional or aesthetic properties art can have, or the aesthetic/emotional states it can put us in&ndash;for example humor, fear, awe, beauty, sexual arousal. Instead of offering arguments or instructive examples in the hope of rationally persuading us to change our moral opinions, artworks can stimulate our nonrational emotional or aesthetic faculties in order to bypass reason and influence how we are disposed to act, feel, and judge. &nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c1\">We can understand this process better by examining two cultural examples, one where many consumers see a possible moral threat but believe they can protect themselves from it (pornography), and one where consumers usually don&rsquo;t see any moral aspect but which might be quite effective at transmitting moral dispositions (&ldquo;South Park&rdquo;). </span></p><h3><span class=\"c1 \">Case: Pornography</span></h3><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c1\">Why are some people so afraid of pornography? Inversely, why are most people so unafraid of it? Closely related reasons. Here I&rsquo;m talking about pornography that could pose some additional moral problem, beyond that which might be posed by the bare fact (no pun intended) of sexually explicit and sexually alluring reproductions of people in images and video. This includes, e.g., incest, abusing a position of authority to manipulate another into sex (boss/secretary, teacher/student), and violent or apparently non-consensual sex. </span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c1\">It is probably obvious why some people are afraid of pornography: they are afraid that when people become sexually aroused while seeing, e.g., a woman being tied up and beaten, they will come to be sexually aroused at the idea of a woman being tied up and beaten. Indeed, the prevalence of porn featuring aggression and gratuitous degradation of women suggests a demand more widespread than fetish niche markets.</span></p><p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c1\">First, the reason people are unafraid of it: many people when using pornography decide &ndash; how explicitly to themselves they make this decision may vary with how much they have worried about porn&rsquo;s moral effects &ndash; to leave their moral sense at the door, where it can neither pass judgment nor, and this is the essential thing, be at all affected. &ldquo;I know that there are some things here I wouldn&rsquo;t approve of, but that doesn&rsquo;t reflect on me and it cannot harm me, because the only part of me involved here is my libido.&rdquo; If Vladimir Nabokov, in an autobiographical appendix to </span><span class=\"c1 \">Lolita, </span><span class=\"c1\">is to be believed, the producers of pornography are quite cooperative in this isolation of sexuality from all other human faculties:</span></p><p class=\"c8\"><span class=\"c1\">in modern times the term pornography connotes mediocrity, commercialism, and certain strict rules of narration. Obscenity must be mated with banality because every kind of aesthetic enjoyment has to be entirely replaced by simple sexual stimulation which demands the traditional word for direct action upon the patient.</span></p><h3><span class=\"c1\">Case: South Park, Season 5, Episode 7: &ldquo;Proper Condom Use&rdquo;</span></h2><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c1\">The children of South Park are found masturbating dogs, having no idea what they are doing (they think they are milking them). After first scolding the children, the adults come to the startling realization: despite their ignorance about sexual matters, kids are being exposed to sex through older peers, through the media, etc. Someone needs to teach them the truth about sex, and how to be safe about it if they partake. But who? Not the parents&mdash;their concerned fervor can&rsquo;t overcome their own squeamishness about talking about sex. The public schools must teach sex ed! But this doesn&rsquo;t work out and the children end up more confused than before&mdash;girls thinking that all boys have AIDS, boys thinking that they need to wear condoms 24/7 in order not to get STDs, all of this ending up with the boys laying a &ldquo;Mad Max&rdquo;-style bloody siege upon the fortress hastily erected by the girls, each group hoping to eliminate or escape the threat once and for all. As the cafeteria chef sums up in a &ldquo;moral of the story&rdquo; scene at the end of the episode, we can&rsquo;t have our children educated about sex by teachers who might be ignorant or have skewed values about the topic: it&rsquo;s parents who have to teach kids about sex in the safe, nurturing setting of the family home. </span></p><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c1\">There is a definite moral/political message here coming from the show&rsquo;s conservative creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker: sex ed should not be taught in schools, and we certainly shouldn&rsquo;t use our taxes to fund it. &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; you may say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not political&mdash;it&rsquo;s just supposed to be funny. The &lsquo;consequences&rsquo; they present are ridiculous. No one actually expects that; it&rsquo;s not going to persuade anyone to change their political positions.&rdquo; But this cartoon is effective in a way that a rational&ndash;even possibly exaggerated&ndash;laying out of the arguments against or possible harmful consequences of sex ed in public schools, couldn&rsquo;t be. The cartoon, by being funny, bypasses the viewers&rsquo; reason altogether, appealing to the faculty of humor (which would seem to share some similarity with whatever part of us reacts to sexual or emotional appeals), so that it can directly influence the viewer&rsquo;s judgments about things. It makes the very idea of sex ed in schools laughable, ridiculous. This could have the additional effect that the viewer is not only inclined against sex ed, but it will be difficult for them to seriously consider it, to rationally engage with the arguments on both sides.</span></p><h3><span class=\"c1 \">Conclusion</span></h2><p class=\"c6\"><span class=\"c1\">These are only two examples, and much more could be said about them. But they make clear the essential point: whether we are aware of it or not, works of art can and do have moral effects on us. They are all the more effective morally because of their ability to appeal to our nonrational faculties. People are especially aware of this in the case of pornography, perhaps because the nonrational element is so readily apparent. I think that such awareness provides a fairly effective moral defense. It is when we don&rsquo;t recognize the existence of a moral message beneath the emotional force that we are most susceptible to it. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></span></p>",

The case studies are sometimes graphic; their purpose is to introduce non-HOCD readers into a (non-exhaustive) range of HOCD experiences. People who are already familiar with HOCD can skip it, especially because it might be too close to home.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">The second part of the article is a glossary. The two conventional terms, &ldquo;repression&rdquo; and &ldquo;in denial,&rdquo; are always spike-risky because of their menacing skepticism. The rest of the words come from the HOCD community itself, so they&rsquo;re safe for most HOCD people. HOCD readers should not take my particular interpretations of these words too seriously, unless it helps them. They know more than I could about their own HOCD and how to help themselves.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">(For everybody else: &ldquo;spike warning&rdquo; is a convention that developed, among other places, on the NeuroticPlanet discussion board for Sexual Obsessions and Compulsions. It&rsquo;s an adaptation of the &ldquo;spoiler alert&rdquo; found on Wikipedia and the &ldquo;trigger alert&rdquo; with which discussions of sexual assault are sometimes prefaced. What &ldquo;spikes&rdquo; and &ldquo;HOCD&rdquo; are will become clear below.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">I should warn queer and gay readers that, due to the nature of HOCD, the idea of homosexuality is an object of panic and shame in these stories. This is </span><span class=\"c4\">not </span><span class=\"c0\">because members of the HOCD community find homosexuality abhorrent or are invested in the privileges of heteronormativity. Rather, the same tactics of catastrophization (to borrow a word from OCD therapeutic discourse) that are instrumental to anti-gay politics make HOCD so virulent, tenacious, and isolating. The HOCD community and broader queer experiences may have a lot in common, and I hope this piece will be an invitation to mutual support, both ideological and in action.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Repressed</i> (for the glossary)</center>\r\n<p ><span class=\"c0\">1. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so ~!&rdquo;<br>Person is unable to have fun or break rules.<br>Person should go drinking.<br>2. &ldquo;~ desire&rdquo; (or esp. &ldquo;~ homosexuality&rdquo;)<br>Something is building inside person.<br>Person is going to explode.<br>Related words: latent, in denial, closeted (in a derivative sense)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cases</h3>\r\n\r\n<p ><span class=\"c0\">A woman gets back together with her boyfriend. She doesn&rsquo;t tell him about the thoughts she has been having. It is a morning in late March and still cold. They have sex in her apartment. She&rsquo;s afraid he can see her blushing, even when she isn&rsquo;t blushing. She can&rsquo;t tell when she&rsquo;s blushing any more. She catches herself pacing around and instead goes to the bathroom. Every time he looks at her she panics and thinks he&rsquo;s about to ask her what&rsquo;s wrong. She says she needs to take a walk. On her way out of their apartment she takes a big breath. She walks to the promontory. At the edge of the water she clambers down a shelf of rock to a place where nobody will see her. She settles into the hollow between two rocks. It is medium-cold. She takes off her hood so that her hot neck and face can begin to recalibrate. She looks roughly in all directions. After a couple minutes, she nods off. </span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">(The online forums that were my main source are private places. In most cases, to adapt stories directly from these forums might have been alarming to the people who told them. Except for the most lighthearted fragments, what appears below should be unrecognizable.)</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">At 4:54PM in the month of August, a man under the username filmbuff59 posts a very long message to an online forum. On such forums, the longer messages usually say how it can start. It is difficult to estimate how much time has passed. He begins with high school. He was skinny, unlucky, and very devoted to masturbating. He says he asked a girl out who he sat next to on the track bus. This backstory, his readers understand, is proof that he liked girls.</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">At college filmbuff59 completely changed. He worked out and ate two-tray meals in the dining hall. In his dorm, he was reputed to be &ldquo;chill.&rdquo; He often had people over for hookah and toweled the door. He got kicked out of housing the second time he ever got high. Unperturbed. He was benching 200lbs. He started dealing. He met a girl that way. When he lost his virginity, she didn&rsquo;t ask if it was his first time, and he didn&rsquo;t tell her. He didn&rsquo;t know what people were supposed to think about while getting head. She asked him how much he liked her, which surprised him. It was very easy to like her, but partly it was so unexpected, dating anybody at all. He tried to make a bigger point of telling her how he felt. It felt funny to cry in front of her. He liked being with her more than with his dorm friends. Their relationship only lasted about a month. She started hooking up with someone in her dorm. He stopped going to the gym. His academic advisor asked him about his grades and arranged for him to see a therapist. He was prescribed an antidepressant.</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">After Christmas, he started having sex with another girl. He was unable to orgasm a lot of the time, especially from oral sex. He stopped seeing her.</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">Winter was dim and shitty where they were. Then it was spring and he felt life welling up in him. New friends were smoking cigarettes on the grass. He talked about movies with an openly gay student named Martin. Martin said he was trying to see everything on the AFI Top 100. filmbuff59 said he wanted to too. Martin and filmbuff59 became friends. One afternoon they ran into each other on the way to class and decided to hang out instead, and milled about on the grass outside, smoking cigarettes and a couple joints. At dinner they ate free food from a student organization&rsquo;s meeting. Martin invited filmbuff59 to lift some weights with him. filmbuff59 benched 160lbs, feeling good. He and his friend went back to his apartment and had some beers. His friend saw </span><span class=\"c4\">Rebel Without a Cause</span><span class=\"c0\"> lying out and said, god how he wanted to fuck James Dean. filmbuff59 laughed and made a joke the concept of which was James Dean being dead. That night he had a dream about his ex. It started off him having sex with her, but then she started to tell him something, about another guy. While he was home for the weekend he heard about a kid from high school. This kid had dated girls but came out after a month in college. Back at school he kept hanging out with Martin, but noticed a new feeling of uneasiness. Once, while they were standing by his movie collection, the thought crossed his mind of kissing him. He was able to dismiss it.</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">A couple days later he ran into his ex-girlfriend and invited her to coffee, but she was uninterested, and he guessed he wasn&rsquo;t that interested either. But he felt a little depressed about it so he called some people. Martin was the first to pick up; he was at a dive bar with a bunch of gay friends, and invited filmbuff59. Martin introduced filmbuff59 as a &ldquo;friend&rdquo; and made a place for him beside himself. filmbuff59 sat down. Martin told the man to the left of filmbuff59 that filmbuff59 was also a film buff. The man acted skeptical. filmbuff59 relaxed. The man to his left sometimes touched his shoulder when they were talking, and was patronizing and flirtatious about filmbuff59&rsquo;s movie tastes. Martin didn&rsquo;t seem to be paying any attention to them, except to advise him loudly, &ldquo;Quentin only likes weird foreign movies.&rdquo; Everyone laughed. For a moment, says filmbuff59, Martin was touching his arm. For the next couple hours he drank and talked and listened to the others talk.</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">In the bathroom, while staring at the reflection of the soap dispenser in the side of the mirror, filmbuff59 sobered up. He wondered if anybody thought he and Martin &ldquo;had something.&rdquo; He felt uneasy about Martin and noticed a strange and possibly positive feeling at the thought. He analyzed this feeling as semi-repressed attraction. He felt dully alarmed, and clenched his abdominal muscles. When he got back he started talking about his ex. It fit his mood, which was no longer convivial. The people around him were annoyed. He went home.</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">The next day he woke up earlier than he wanted to (nine or ten) and felt shitty and hungover and remembered the bar. He made instant coffee. Air came in an open window and he recalled that it was spring. He remembered hanging out with his friends. He felt glad. Suddenly, he felt aroused. BANG! He remembered thinking about kissing his friend Martin. He sat. He did not have the energy to stop thinking about it, about leaning over to him and kissing him, standing by his movie collection. He thought he might have a half-erection. He was tense all over. He stared ahead to the left of the TV and felt dizzier and felt &ldquo;it&rdquo; growing. He thought about his sex drive lately and about oral and about not orgasming and also the thought, &ldquo;Putting the pieces together.&rdquo; Which was not exactly something </span><span class=\"c4\">he</span><span class=\"c0\"> thought; </span><span class=\"c4\">he</span><span class=\"c0\"> didn&rsquo;t think really these were pieces to put together. &ldquo;Why am I thinking so much about this,&rdquo; he considered. He thought he might be talking himself into having a crush on this guy. He thought, if that&rsquo;s possible, what&rsquo;s the difference? It shouldn&rsquo;t matter whether you talk yourself into a feeling or not, the feeling is the feeling. He felt nauseous and, to his horror, excited. Had he been thinking about a girl, he thought, he might have interpreted this feeling as &ldquo;butterflies in his stomach.&rdquo; He had a headache.</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">Another person&rsquo;s story: &ldquo;I distinctly remember the moment HOCD struck me. I was working at a Jimmy John&rsquo;s, during my senior year of college. For whatever reason, as I sat there, bored out of my mind, I thought, &lsquo;What if I&rsquo;m gay?&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">Another user&rsquo;s HOCD started at high school. He heard a rumor that he was gay. He had said something that sounded really gay at a party, about how he loved pulpy orange juice, how it fills your throat and almost chokes you. People looked at each other and he laughed too because it was actually hilarious. Afterwards he wished he had said, &ldquo;I see that that sounds really gay,&rdquo; rather than just blushing. When people teased him about being gay he felt sick and restless, or aggressive in a way he associated with sexual tension. He started catching himself in gay poses or with a melodic &ldquo;gay&rdquo; quality to his laugh. When this occurred, he felt a strange aroused feeling, which made him think it was not just a coincidence. This aroused feeling wasn&rsquo;t really about other men, he knew, but just about the idea of being gay. So he was attracted to being attracted to other men. But eventually he had the feeling about men too. He thought it was probably by association with the idea of being gay, which is what actually (for some reason) aroused him. Did that make sense?</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to feel this,&rdquo; someone thinks. &ldquo;Do I feel this?&rdquo; He thinks, &ldquo;Does everybody feel this?&rdquo; &ldquo;Have I always felt this, but never paid attention?&rdquo; &ldquo;Am I feeling this because I am paying attention?&rdquo; &ldquo;Maybe other people don&rsquo;t feel this,&rdquo; he thinks, &ldquo;even if they start paying attention.&rdquo; He reads literally hundreds of coming out stories. The thought of &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; gives him &ldquo;butterflies in his stomach.&rdquo; He wants to puke.</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">One user says these thoughts have been part of his life for several years. He learned to talk about it. He&rsquo;s gotten used to not knowing whether people understand or believe him. If people want to think he&rsquo;s &ldquo;in the closet,&rdquo; whatever. He&rsquo;s also used to feeling defensive at weird times, if someone seems to understand too quickly. He almost yelled at one friend for telling him &ldquo;everybody experiences anxiety.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just anxiety,&rdquo; he tells her. &ldquo;OK,&rdquo; she pauses. &ldquo;But it still seems like anxiety is, like, the main affect.&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more like, your brain doesn&rsquo;t work. You&rsquo;re short-circuited. &nbsp;And you feel autistic.&rdquo; He thinks about it and then has an idea. &ldquo;You know what it&rsquo;s like, actually. It&rsquo;s like a bad trip.&rdquo;</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">filmbuff59 describes new behaviors from this period: he &ldquo;got up his courage&rdquo; to watch gay porn. He thinks he might have felt aroused when he watched. He thinks, if you are aroused, you want to masturbate. But he doesn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;the courage&rdquo; to masturbate. When he walks to class now men catch his eye. Sometimes he looks at them because he wants see if he is attracted. They often notice him looking at them, and make eye contact with him. When their eyes meet, he thinks he feels himself becoming aroused.</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">He says he often draws up diagrams of different ways of looking at it. He lists all the things that are evidence that he is gay, all the things that are evidence that he is straight. Evidence that he is straight: he always liked girls; he was in love with his first girlfriend; he was sad afterward; he never had (or had very few) gay thoughts before college. Evidence that he is gay&hellip;</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">When he is on campus he thinks he sees Martin everywhere. It sends a jolt of adrenaline to his stomach. He tries to think of excuses for not seeing Martin any more. He decides not to see anybody. He pretends to be depressed. He </span><span class=\"c4\">is </span><span class=\"c0\">depressed. When he sees his therapist he lies sometimes, and refuses to answer anything in detail. He hates having to come up with complicated stories. It makes his head hurt. One day at the dining hall a girl says, &ldquo;Do you think if you knew what someone thought about every single day, you would know something about them?&rdquo; filmbuff59 feels sick. It would be better to hurt himself or something, make himself puke, smash his head in a door, scream or something. He doesn&rsquo;t hurt himself, though, because he thinks that might be how people end up OCD. He thinks nostalgically about when he was depressed in high school or when his girlfriend dumped him.</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">The whole story falls apart. filmbuff59 doesn&rsquo;t say what happened to his friendship with Martin. It probably ended. He says he is older now, out of college. On his most extreme days he sits at home with a ruler. He has learned from looking at pictures of various objects that his penis sometimes grows to 5 inches in length at the sight of nonsexual objects or animals and to 7.5 inches in length at heterosexual porn. When he feels himself becoming aroused at a gay thought, he measures right away to get an accurate reading. If it is between 5 and 7.5 inches, he grits his teeth and lies down on his stomach. He has also acquired a detailed knowledge of the types of &ldquo;positive feelings&rdquo; he might have about other people. When he feels a positive feeling about a woman, he compares it to his positive feelings about men. He can never decide whether his negative feelings about men count as part of the feelings, or if he should say that he feels the same way about men as about women, with negative feelings in addition, in reaction those positive feelings. His feelings about women are difficult to evaluate, too, because he no longer thinks about women at all except in order to compare his feelings about them to his feelings about men. He knows that his feelings about women used to be stronger, but he has trouble remembering how they felt.</span></p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center><p ><span class=\"c0\">A woman in her early thirties has preserved the following memory as the single worst in her life.

If there were a textbook, that is.&quot; <br>&ndash; NeuroticPlanet member, 1/25/07</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Judging from search volume, the acronym HOCD, which stands for Homosexuality-themed Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, first appeared on the internet at the end of 2004. The concept then developed in a dialogue between a growing online public and the few specialists who took notice.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">The proximate sources for the theme seem to be two articles written by therapists specializing in OCD. A brief article on the subject by Fred Penzel called &ldquo;How Do I Know I&rsquo;m Not Really Gay?&rdquo; (which does not yet use the acronym HOCD) is recorded to have been online since <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.homestead.com/westsuffolkpsych/am_i_gay.html\">October 20, 2004</a></span><span class=\"c0\">, and has been a linked reference in the Wikipedia article on &ldquo;Intrusive thoughts&rdquo; since <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle=Intrusive_thoughts%26oldid=97751250\">January 2007</a></span><span class=\"c0\">. Meanwhile, a short <a href=\"http://www.ocdonline.com/articlephillipson7.php\">piece</a></span><span class=\"c0\"> by Steven Phillipson called &ldquo;I think it moved: The understanding and treatment of the obsessional doubt related to sexual orientation and relationship substantiation&rdquo; was first posted on or before <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.ocdonline.com/articlesphillipson.php\">March 22, 2005</a></span><span class=\"c0\"> at the web page for Phillipson&rsquo;s New York treatment center. Phillipson&rsquo;s article does not seem to have been cited early on except on help forums, where his name is well-known. Neither of these articles uses the expression HOCD, whose precise coinage I don&rsquo;t know.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">The forums on BrainPhysics, a professional mental health resources website, were probably the site of the HOCD community&rsquo;s birth. They existed from late 2005 to mid 2006; the &ldquo;Sexual Obsessions &amp; Compulsions&rdquo; forum referred to HOCD in its description since the beginning. Mark, a member of the BrainPhysics forums suffering from non-H OCD, wrote a short piece for BrainPhysics&rsquo;s main website called &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Gay but You&rsquo;re Not&rdquo; in <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20060226034659/http://brainphysics.com/forum\">August 2005</a></span><span class=\"c0\">, having been &ldquo;bombarded&hellip; for nine months by threads, private messages, e-mail, and instant messages by straight folks [from the forum] terrified that they are gay (and a very small number of gay and bisexual folks terrified that they, too, are not their real sexual orientation.)&rdquo; A second piece on HOCD was added to the site, possibly in response to a user-submitted question, in Winter 2006. Mark&rsquo;s article is still online, and no longer refers to the BrainPhysics forums. In <a http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.neuroticplanet.com/forum\">2006</a></span><span class=\"c0\"> these forums were transplanted from BrainPhysics&rsquo;s main site to NeuroticPlanet, where they remain. Google Insights charts a brief increase in searches for &ldquo;HOCD forum&rdquo; in fall 2007 and a sustained increase at the end of 2008.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Monnica Williams, who is also involved as a consultant for BrainPhysics and NeuroticPlanet, delivered a talk on HOCD in fall 2008 at the New Jersey affiliate of the Obsessive Compulsive Foundation, which was published that year in </span><span class=\"c4\">Leading-Edge Health Education Issues</span><span class=\"c0\">. In the paper she thanks &ldquo;the membership of the Neurotic Planet [sic] OCD Discussion Forum&rdquo; for their contributions. This was, as far as I can tell, the first article on HOCD written exclusively for medical specialists (Penzel&rsquo;s and Phillipson&rsquo;s articles being written for sufferers). I know of no further activity among specialists, though OCD treatment centers and medical Q&amp;A sites have continued to treat the subject.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">So much for the history of the concept. A word on the demographics of the sufferers. Outsiders to these forums often assume 1) that HOCD sufferers come from religious or right-wing backgrounds, are homophobes, or think that homosexuality is wrong, 2) that HOCD sufferers are male, and 3) that HOCD sufferers are only straight people worried about being gay (as opposed to, for example, gay people worried about being straight.) But </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">1) Many HOCD sufferers are from tolerant, liberal backgrounds. Though the data&rsquo;s inadequate, it seems like about the same proportions are urban, suburban, and rural, red-state and blue-state, as America is. (Though not all are American&mdash;plenty are Canadian and British&mdash;and &ldquo;TOC homosexualidad&rdquo; or &ldquo;TOC homosexuel&rdquo; return some results on google.fr and .es.)</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">2) It seems from my very casual research that somewhere from a third to half of sufferers are female. Most people don&rsquo;t explicitly mention their gender when they post, and adjectives in English don&rsquo;t reveal it, but once they start talking about the things that scare them it is clear which is the same sex. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">3) It can usually be assumed that HOCD people are straight, unless they state otherwise. Nonetheless, all the following groups are represented, if in small numbers:</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">- straight people worrying that they are gay</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">- straight people worrying that they are bi</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">- bi people worrying that they are gay</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">- bi people worrying that they are straight </span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">- gay people worrying that they are bi</span></p><p class=\"c3\"><span class=\"c0\">- gay people worrying that they are straight. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">[Note: See my <a href=\"/2/gross-afterthoughts.html\">afterthoughts</a> on this point, especially towards the end; the above table is incomplete.] The sample size is very small for these last three groups. Their behaviors and symptoms seem to be largely the same, though their experience of mainstream discourse on sexuality is bound to be different&mdash;that is, different clich&eacute;s will feel hale or hostile to each group. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">In this article I have tried to be careful about gender, but it&rsquo;s usually too complicated to leave gender and sexual orientation ambiguous at the same time. The vast majority of my examples, too, are of men or women worried about being gay or bi. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<center><i>Checking</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p ><span class=\"c0\">Checking describes a group of behaviors common in people with HOCD:</span></p><p class=\"c5\">- adopting cadences and &ldquo;lisps&rdquo; perceived as gay or as gender-nonconforming in order to see if they fit</p><p class=\"c5\">- making gestures perceived as gay or as gender-nonconforming in order to see if they are enjoyable</p><p class=\"c5\">- watching for such gestures; even recording their voice or videotaping their walk</p><p class=\"c5\">- observing gay people they see very closely, seeing whether they can imagine themselves in their shoes, looking for aspects of the life that fit or don&rsquo;t fit</p><p class=\"c5\">- making eye-contact with people of the same sex in order to gauge emotional or physical reactions</p><p class=\"c5\">- scrutinizing all positive same-sex feelings for traces of desire or romantic love</p><p class=\"c5\">- asking themselves whether or not their same-sex friendships are &ldquo;too close,&rdquo; whether or not their feelings for their friends of the same sex are &ldquo;platonic&rdquo; </p><p class=\"c5\">- watching gay porn to gauge arousal</p><p class=\"c5\">- looking at people of the same sex as they walk down the street, scrutinizing one&rsquo;s own reaction (excitement, happiness, affection, crush, arousal, weakness, tingling, fear, anxiety can mean homosexuality)</p><p class=\"c5\">- looking at asses, crotches, breasts, neck, muscles, thighs, lips of people of the same sex in order to gauge emotional or physical reaction</p><p class=\"c5\">- trying to masturbate to gay porn</p><p class=\"c5\">- scrutinizing their heterosexual desire for lack of intensity or genuineness</span>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p ><span class=\"c0\">The word &ldquo;checking&rdquo; does not originate in the HOCD community, but its meaning there is different from in general OCD theory. In general, &ldquo;checking&rdquo; describes the compulsion to repeatedly check things normally taken for granted: whether the lights are on, or the stove, whether one has left one&rsquo;s wallet at home, whether the house is unlocked, whether one has hurt one&rsquo;s child. In the context of certain OCD themes, HOCD and ROCD (Relationship-themed OCD, obsessive doubt of romantic feelings) among others, the checking takes place not externally but introspectively. Sufferers check something much more ambiguous than the position of a light switch. And whereas someone might check the light switch only in order to make sure it&rsquo;s off, someone with HOCD checks their reactions to homoerotic ideas in order to verify a piece of self-knowledge. If someone gets the &ldquo;wrong answer,&rdquo; they may panic. In that case, the checking compulsion and all their other symptoms become intensified; they &ldquo;spike&rdquo; (q.v.).</span></p><p ><span class=\"c0\">The fact that checking is introspective in HOCD highlights an important difference between this form and others. Phillipson makes the crucial observation that HOCD and ROCD, unlike other themes of OCD, refer constantly to norms of self-interpretation and decision-making completely unproblematic for most sexual or romantic subjectivities. Above all, the emotional heuristics for self-definition and object choice give surprising, contradictory, and unintelligible readings and seem &quot;out of order.&quot; As one HOCD person writes: &ldquo;I think I&#39;ve broken the psychological mechanism for &lsquo;wanting&rsquo; things by scrutinizing it too closely and now nothing is clear.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">It&rsquo;s misleading to say that HOCD and ROCD are intense and hyperbolic enactments of very normal questions (as opposed to other forms of OCD that thematize in domains less thoroughly covered by our culture&#39;s emotional tutelage.) The truth is that the HOCD subject is completely unable to engage in such questions the way a normal subject would, for two reasons: 1) because the subject&rsquo;s interpretive activity loses all of the coordinates (liberation, pride, positive curiosity, positively valuated pleasure) of &ldquo;normal&rdquo; sexuality; 2) because, for HOCD subjects, the hermeneutic framework of sexual identity decisions has been repeatedly discredited by its extreme inconclusiveness and its tendency to contradict itself.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><center><i>In denial</i></center><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Most commonly with reference to loss: of e.g. a loved one, a war. People in denial (henceforth PIDs) are, in this usage, in denial about external realities that anybody could verify by a universally recognized, unproblematic procedure.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">We also speak about denial when someone refuses to acknowledge, for example, a pattern in their behavior, or refuses to acknowledge that &ldquo;they need help.&rdquo; In these examples, people are not really in denial about external reality. It takes interpretation to discern a &ldquo;pattern of behavior&rdquo; (some behaviors must be counted as significant, others passed over, and many different actions have to be grouped into a single pattern). The assertion that someone &ldquo;needs help&rdquo; is even less neutral.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">At the risk of stating the obvious, it can be added that whoever uses this phrase gains authority over the PID. A grief-crazed lover might need to be watched over and taken care of. Someone who &ldquo;needs help&rdquo; might need to be yelled at by a large group of friends and/or institutionalized and/or forced to go to rehab.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Denial in sexual orientation is clearly not a denial of external reality; it belongs with the latter examples: denial about a &ldquo;pattern of behavior,&rdquo; denial about &ldquo;needing help.&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">All those examples authorize the people around the PID to intervene or at least gossip knowingly about their business. These interventions and this authority are justified by the fact that the PID cannot take care of themselves. But does a gay person in denial need to be committed? Are they a danger to themselves and others? Are they unable to live their own lives? The answer to these questions should be NO, NO, NO. It&rsquo;s one thing to display support for someone who might be gay, or to invite someone to try out something they might enjoy; such gestures are often worth the risk that they will be unwanted or triggering. But people in our culture seem to think they know better than the PID about the right way of dealing with their sexuality, whether that means embracing a gay lifestyle or just admitting the truth.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">HOCD readers may remember a time they tallied up &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; that they were in denial, or when someone received their urgent confidences with skepticism. It&rsquo;s often futile to fight such suspicion, because &ldquo;denying&rdquo; is already the accusation. At such times, it might help to temporarily identify as a PID: &ldquo;I am in denial, and I remain free to live in denial: partially, wholly, or to a normal degree.&rdquo; Be proud of it, you &ldquo;hypocrite readers&rdquo; of sexuality, and sing along with me: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my party / I deny if I want to.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><center><i>Reassurance</i></center>\r\n<p ><span class=\"c0\">Here are some selections from the first page of Google results for HOCD:</span></p><p class=\"c5\">- &ldquo;How do I know if I&rsquo;m gay?&rdquo;</p><p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c0\">- &ldquo;Gay, straight, or HOCD?&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c0\">- &ldquo;help guys do i have hocd does it actually exist&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c0\">- &ldquo;do i have hocd or am i just in denial&rdquo;</span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c0\">- &ldquo;How Do I Know I&rsquo;m Not Gay?&rdquo;</span></p><p ><span class=\"c0\">Browse the NeuroticPlanet forums and you&rsquo;ll find a huge number of posts asking questions like these. From these and other HOCD forums, it seems like this type of scrupulously honest self-questioning is a consistent feature of HOCD. And these inquiries also follow an extremely consistent pattern:</span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c0\">1. Doubts arise.</span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c0\">2. The HOCD person asks whether or not they are gay. They may ask somebody who claims some kind of authority, or they may try to figure out through introspective checking.</span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c0\">3. They may be given a reassuring answer or come by themselves to a reassuring conclusion.</span></p><p class=\"c5\"><span class=\"c0\">4. They soon begin to doubt their own judgment or the expertise of whoever gave them the reassuring answer. &nbsp;They reexamine their logic, inference by inference.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">The word &ldquo;reassurance&rdquo; comes from general OCD therapy where it functions the same way as in HOCD discourse. It is a derogatory word with a disciplinary edge. Users advise each other to &ldquo;stop looking for reassurance,&rdquo; or occasionally apologize for doing so themselves during a particularly acute episode.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">The concept of reassurance is especially resonant within HOCD discourse, despite originating outside it. For one thing, it&rsquo;s curiously symmetrical with &ldquo;denial&rdquo;; and it has in common with &ldquo;sexual repression&rdquo; its futility. Just as the &ldquo;beast in the closet&rdquo; will inevitably emerge, the banal rationality of reassurance will inevitably be undone. But it will be undone by still more reasoning. In this way, the concept of reassurance provides HOCD sufferers with an alternate explanation for the persistence of their doubts. This alternate explanation corresponds to a different narrative arc: in place of the &ldquo;destiny&rdquo; of latent homosexuality, it proposes a plateau of obsession that might or might not gradually abate, but that in no way terminates in the explosion of sexual &ldquo;truth.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><center><i>Internalized Homophobia</i></center><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Not all of the HOCD community&rsquo;s terminology is as helpful as &ldquo;reassurance.&rdquo; A few words become popular because of their ability to cause dismay (see &ldquo;spiking&rdquo;). Every time it appears on NeuroticPlanet&rsquo;s HOCD board, internalized homophobia is part of an obsessive doubt: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference between HOCD and internalized homophobia?&rdquo; The concept of IH is alarming to HOCD people because it interferes with a popular rule for &ldquo;distinguishing&rdquo; between HOCD and homosexuality: that HOCD people suffer psychologically whereas well-adjusted gay people are happy to be gay. Taken seriously, the concept of IH could be an alternate interpretation of the symptoms grouped under HOCD. &nbsp;But in fact it&rsquo;s just the mainstream interpretation, the only one that was available to HOCD people before 2004, and the one they can STILL expect to receive from the average therapist (see Williams 202: &ldquo;Because homosexual anxiety is not well-described in the research literature, people with HOCD may have difficulty finding knowledgeable treatment providers.&rdquo;)</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">HOCD people, especially with the support of their community, are able to take a stand for the idea of HOCD and against these suspicions. But they should be careful not to impose their self-interpretation on people outside the HOCD community who find the concept of internalized homophobia useful. Everyone in the HOCD community should be careful (as they have been up until now) not to deny the existence of IH. Such an interpretive imposition is exactly what HOCD people suffer at the hands of the mainstream.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><center><i>Spiking</i></center>\r\n<p ><span class=\"c0\">A spike (the word, like reassurance and checking, comes from general OCD treatment discourse) in one sense means an intensification of all symptoms. The sufferer increasingly believes they are gay (or bi or straight, depending on what they&rsquo;re fearing), increasingly asks reassurance, increasingly puts themselves and their body through tests, increasingly checks for feelings, reactions, erections; panics; feels nauseous; feels liking/feels a crush; feels tender; feels doomed; feels certain; feels unhinged (bad trip, fevered); asks for help, cries, shouts, or stares blankly; feels aroused; blushes; feels oversensitive; feels overbooked/overclocked. Some members of NeuroticPlanet even report a feeling of bliss and power (see this sometimes very disturbing <a href=\"http://neuroticplanet.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=20386\">thread</a></span><span class=\"c0\"> (extreme spike warning), a lesson in the ecstatic/prophetic dimension of catastrophization).</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Spikes have some phenomenal overlap with &ldquo;panic attacks&rdquo; or &ldquo;anxiety episodes.&rdquo; Just as a panic attack is not just a feeling but a dynamic or accent of feeling, a spike is not just a cluster of feelings, mental compulsions, and physical responses, but also the &ldquo;rise&rdquo; in the same phenomena. The &ldquo;groinal&rdquo; connotations of &ldquo;spike&rdquo; may add to its appropriateness to HOCD, more obviously for HOCD males than females. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">Spikes are not always dramatic. They can run their course in someone while they watch a film, have a conversation, sit in class or at work, or have sex, without necessarily interfering. Some HOCD sufferers get so used to passing spikes that they don&rsquo;t even lose their train of thought.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><center><i>Groinal Response</i></center>\r\n<p ><span class=\"c0\">The concept of &ldquo;groinal response&rdquo; is sure to be the HOCD community&rsquo;s most controversial and unintuitive piece of re-interpretation. The fact that many (perhaps most) HOCD people do experience physical signs of arousal as part of their spike or in their daily life (possibly triggering a spike) may be taken by people outside the community as a clear sign that they are really &ldquo;in denial.&rdquo; Getting an erection from some thought (though we need to remember that many, maybe even half, of HOCD sufferers are women), for example, would be, for some people, the surest sign of sexual orientation. Even people with HOCD welcome the erections they want to get (around a significant other, for example) as proof that, at least, they still like the opposite sex (or same sex, if they&rsquo;re gay HOCD sufferers.) But just as HOCD sufferers feel themselves to be atypical with respect to introspection&mdash;thus deprived of the ordinary sources of self-knowledge or conscious will&mdash;they have experienced something idiosyncratic with respect to the physical signs of their desire. Their groinal responses seems in conflict with other things they know about themselves; they get groinal responses from a set of stimuli or ideas that would also be unusual if they were gay (for example, an HOCD person might note the seeming lack of selectivity in their physical arousal&mdash;even at unattractive persons, members of their family, animals, or just everything). Maybe they get groinal responses less in relation to same-sex objects than in relation to the assertion that they are gay. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">But of course it is also common to doubt whether one&rsquo;s groinal responses are that idiosyncratic after all; and if a distinction is made between groinal response and arousal, an HOCD person will almost inevitably question whether or not it actually &ldquo;counts.&rdquo; In the end it is often necessary for an HOCD person to give themselves permission to just call whatever they want a groinal response without worrying about whether this interpretation is justified by some kind of two-column chart of the difference between groinal response and arousal. Ultimately such charts are only counterproductive. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;Groinal response&rdquo; is a flexible category whose most important function is to give the HOCD person leeway in interpreting themselves. The axioms of this interpretation are: that physical arousal is not the expression of a catastrophic, unstoppable desire; that groinal responses do not point to a sexual act; that the failure to engage in this sexual act is neither frustration nor disappointment; that celibacy (of any kind) does not mean an empty or sad life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c0\">One of my goals in this article was to propose to the HOCD community a few conceptual tools from queer theory. One of the tasks of queer theory is to invent interpretive leeway for people who are excluded or tyrannized by the dominant sexual hermeneutic&mdash;something that the HOCD community has learned to do for itself. Even straight HOCD people have a lot in common with queer and gay people: their marginal and difficult subject-position, their shame, their silence, their interpretive creativity (on which they often depend for survival), their exposure to minor narratives of sexuality, their instincts of self-protection. Anyone with HOCD who wants to see what support they can get from or give to the queer community could read the short first volume of Foucault&rsquo;s </span><span class=\"c4\">History of Sexuality</span><span class=\"c0\"> (especially to understand the history and politics of the concept of repression) or something by Eve Sedgwick (</span><span class=\"c4\">Epistemology of the Closet</span><span class=\"c0\"> would be particularly germane), or just click around the blogosphere.&nbsp;<img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></span></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Legend, the murmuring brain of religion and social custom, frequently explores the shadowy territory at the juncture of human spirituality and terrestrial desire. Because the secular yearnings of individuals are often at odds with the collective spiritual needs of their community, traditional practices are needed as a mediating force. Thus religious tradition evolves in a dynamic with the transgressive elements of the community it services, so that aberrant individuals are either demonized or, preferably, folded back into the community&ndash;in either case they are incorporated into the religious system and given significance within it. Several religious cultures imagine romantic relationships, and even marriages, between humans and otherworldly beings, relationships that can be read as symbolic compromises between secular or counter-traditional desires and an embrace of religious orthodoxy. These stories offer consolation and a &ldquo;way out&rdquo; for both aberrant members of society and their families, replacing shame with respect, if not pride.</span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">In the legend of St. Catherine of Siena, such a dynamic between individual desire, social expectation, and religious fulfillment is outlined with keen psychological insight. The mystical marriage of St. Catherine was a popular subject in Christian art and storytelling from around St. Catherine of Siena&rsquo;s own lifetime in the mid-fourteenth century through the seventeenth century, though the earliest images date from a few years prior to Catherine of Siena&rsquo;s birth and depict the mythical St. Catherine of </span><span class=\"c4\">Alexandria</span><span class=\"c2\">, fabled to have lived a thousand years earlier. The images are frequently bizarre and always fascinating, depicting the women&rsquo;s visions of their heavenly marriages to Christ. Often, the heavenly bridegroom is the Christ child supported by an obliging mother, and occasionally, he weds </span><span class=\"c4\">both</span><span class=\"c2\"> Catherines at once, shattering the restrictions of time and monogamy. Each St. Catherine was a model for religious unorthodoxy and a patron for Christian women: St. Catherine of Alexandria was tortured on the Catherine Wheel for besting the Emperor&rsquo;s philosophers in a debate and was an inspiration for Joan of Arc; St. Catherine of Siena was interrogated for heresy, and appears as a notable eccentric in a contemporary account of her life, </span><span class=\"c4\">The Miracoli of Saint Catherine</span><span class=\"c2\">. </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\"></span><span class=\"c4\">The Miracoli of Saint Catherine</span><span class=\"c2\">, written by an anonymous resident of Siena around 1347, depicts her conversion to faith as a controversial affair within her family and community, as a moment not of religious deliverance but of psychological uncertainty. In the tale, the seven-year-old Catherine is depicted as an odd and reclusive child, suffering from fear of divine punishment after seeing a vision of God perched in a cave. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">More predominant than Catherine&rsquo;s spiritual anxiety is her distaste for human company, an overpowering hermetic impulse that causes her to avoid her family, eventually run away from home, and seek refuge in a cave. It is there, in this isolation, that she prays to the Virgin Mary, begging that she be permitted to wed Mary&rsquo;s son, Christ. Upon making this entreaty, Catherine ascends into the air where she is greeted by an image of the heavenly Virgin presenting her son, who extends a wedding ring and actively espouses Catherine. Not only has Catherine requested and received a blessing directly from heaven, but she has also proposed marriage to a man, albeit through the intermediary of his mother, inverting the established gradient between divine and terrestrial, masculine and feminine. After the vision of her mystical marriage, Catherine returns home. </span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c2\">One of the most strikingly unusual elements of the </span><span class=\"c4\">Miracoli</span><span class=\"c2\">&rsquo;s account is its focus on Catherine&rsquo;s psychological motivation to retreat from her surroundings, rather than her piety. She would rather live in a dark rift in the earth than marry a man on earth, and finds a middle ground in religious monasticism. Earlier in the story, we learn that Catherine had a &ldquo;married sister&rdquo; (always enigmatically identified as &ldquo;married,&rdquo; though we known nothing else about her) who dies soon after Catherine&rsquo;s mystical marriage. When a friar visits her family to offer his consolation, Catherine confesses her vision to him. He responds by encouraging her in her desire to turn her back on the world. The author tells us with understandable amazement that the seven-year-old Catherine suddenly makes a vow to Christ: &ldquo;I promise to give you my virginity forever and you will be the guardian of my purity.&rdquo; </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Hereafter, we&rsquo;re told, Catherine becomes even stouter in her avoidance of her father, mother, and other family members, not to mention outside society. But her family pesters her to look forward to finding herself a nice man like any normal child, and as she grows older, she continues to pray to God that he protect her and allow her to keep her vow, retreating into the upper floor of her house and avoiding her family for days at a time. She also refuses to eat, and her anorexia later finds spiritual expression in her decision to subsist solely on her daily host. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">As described in the </span><span class=\"c4\">Miracoli</span><span class=\"c2\">, St. Catherine appears to be led by a neurotic preference for solitude and nervous anorexia, which find an appropriate expression under her social conditions in the monastic life. Conceivably, a whole class of woman walked in St. Catherine&rsquo;s shadow in the middle, becoming a &ldquo;bride of Christ&rdquo; as the only alternative to marriage, out of shame of some imagined impurity, or for other reasons beyond mere piety. Such women do appear elsewhere in medieval literature, most notably in </span><span class=\"c4\">The Canterbury Tales</span><span class=\"c2\">, in which the character Emelye, tugged between the brothers Palamon and Arcite, prays to Diana that she be saved from having to marry either of them. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Nor is this paradigm unique to Christian communities whose members are governed by harsh traditional oversight. Chinese traditions rooted in ancestor worship have similarly offered women the option to opt out of the religious system by taking advantage of superstition. According to Janice Stockard&rsquo;s </span><span class=\"c4\">Daughters of the Canon Delta: Marriage Patterns and Economic Strategies in South China</span><span class=\"c2\">, the &ldquo;spirit marriage&rdquo; offers women in traditional South Chinese communities an escape from the expectation that they take a husband. In the theology of ancestor worship, a family can only honor the spirits of male family members and their wives&mdash;the souls of unmarried women are unattached to a home in the afterlife, and doomed to limbo. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Hence, prior to marriage, women had no future lineage to pray for their soul, and to remain unmarried was to damn one&rsquo;s soul to an eternal limbo without descendants to welcome and care for one&rsquo;s ghost. Stockard defines &ldquo;bride-initiated spirit marriage&rdquo; as a &ldquo;marriage-resistance practice&rdquo; in which a woman could take control of her destiny by entering into a marital bond with a deceased bachelor&mdash;after death, her soul would be cared for by the buried husband&rsquo;s family, but she would obviously continue to live a unmarried life in all but name. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">These two instances of </span><span class=\"c4\">metaphysical marriage</span><span class=\"c2\">, the St. Catherine paradigm and the spirit marriage, likely do not simply </span><span class=\"c4\">conceal</span><span class=\"c2\"> a personal inclination to remaining unmarried, but instead bind the individual&rsquo;s earthly desires to the community&rsquo;s spiritual needs, generating acceptable patterns of behavior. The dynamic between, on the one hand, a secular desire that runs counter to tradition and community pressures, and, on the other, the adoption of a lifestyle rooted in superstition, is complex. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">On the one hand, St. Catherine resists orthodoxy through an exaggerated show of obedience to it (her refusal to take a husband alienates her family, though it is also evidence of her radical faith). Jesus Freak cults of the 1960s like David Berg&rsquo;s Children of God are another example of this paradigm, legitimating their unconventional sexual morality and other alternative lifestyle choices in biblical interpretation. The Children of God&rsquo;s &ldquo;flirty fishers&rdquo; were religious prostitutes who acted as &ldquo;bait&rdquo; to lure new converts into the cult, and whose existence Berg justified with a line from Matthew that compares the act of proselytizing to fishing, arguably bending the obliging and stoned faith of cult members to feed his own megalomania, but nevertheless shattering religious tradition from within itself. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Instances of secularly motivated religious action like Catherine&rsquo;s mystic marriage could also have a conservative, stabilizing influence on traditional societies, reaching out to fold secular desires and cultural aberration into systems of cultural orthodoxy. Catherine&rsquo;s bizarre behavior isn&rsquo;t seen as anti-social by visitors to her monastery, but rather as prophetic; while the women with spirit husbands gain a degree of freedom from their decision to take a spouse without the responsibilities and entanglements of a flesh and blood husband, they also make a compromise to the religious community by acknowledging the necessity of securing a spiritual future. By creating the &ldquo;brides of Christ&rdquo; paradigm that Dominican nuns and other sects of consecrated virgins would adhere to, St. Catherine created a new traditional function for a St. Catherine type to aspire to beyond becoming a wife and mother. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Finally, much like the Children of God, the fertile crescent&rsquo;s cults of Ishtar and Astarte worshipped fertility by visiting a temple staffed by prostitutes, to whom visitors paid obeisance by partaking of her divine love by proxy. Here, the distinction between spirituality and earthly desire is most obscured, as Ishtar&rsquo;s temple creates a space for both worship and the fulfillment of the earthly urges of the cults&rsquo; priests. </span></p><p class=\"c1\"><span class=\"c2\">Of course, traditional systems tend not to be floating monoliths of law in the first place, but rather dynamic playing fields that adapt to transgressions and abnormalities in order to survive and provide order. St. Catherine is a model for how myths rationalize hazy psychological territory by fitting it into a standard language. Rather than cast its aberrant members out into the wilderness, traditional systems frequently prefer to carve out a space for them, to call them back from self-imposed exile and house them in impromptu enclaves, whether at society&rsquo;s spiritual core or on its social periphery. Tradition&rsquo;s adaptive ability permits it to evolve with historic forces, and its ability to incorporate challenges to itself allows it to adapt in the face of new challenges. Tradition cannot afford to function as a hegemon, by excluding the worldly and the psychologically unorthodox, since it lives in human belief and practice, and since people embrace spiritual tradition as a way to establish social unity. The marriage myth&rsquo;s popularity can be attributed to its structural function in traditional communities, in which it opens space for both orthodoxy and tolerance.&nbsp;<img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></span></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nMemes are commonly thought of as fads or inside jokes of microbial scale that worm their ways through an organic system&mdash;such as the internet&mdash;while evolving from slogan to crudely Photoshopped image to video while maintaining some basic DNA. Even when this DNA is a trivial and arbitrary substance, memes can be as powerful as computer viruses. In America, they have turned normal people into overnight celebrities, sometimes damaging lives, and become a marketing industry clich\u00e9. And in their attempts to penetrate the online immune system known in the West as the Great Firewall, Chinese internet users have injected memes with the genetic code of revolutionary dissent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThough clever, the term &ldquo;Great Firewall&rdquo; is reductive nomenclature for China&rsquo;s next-generation model of repression. The Chinese government&rsquo;s mechanisms of online censorship are only a fragment of the full picture, and focusing on them presents a misleading image of totalitarian shadow agencies with full control over the media. Chinese companies like Baidu (Google-like search engine), TenCent (instant messenger service), Sina Weibo (Twitter-like microblogging platform), Renren (Facebook-like social networking platform), and Youku and Toudu (YouTube-like video sites) and their competitors not only provide a web-based social forum that could unite in mass protest, but also serve as contractors for government censorship, voluntarily deploying both word filters and teams of staff to expunge dissident speech from their servers. They consider these investments well worth the market share of China&rsquo;s 400 million (and counting) internet users.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMore significant than an official directive, online companies face a profit motive to censor customers&rsquo; content. Similarly, it appears that internet users are more urgently motivated by their desire for immediate expression than their abstract yearning for political freedom and openness. As long as internet users can find a way to get through official and corporate firewalls, they may continue to opt for quiet resistance over revolution&mdash;which is by no means a failure for progress. The Charter 08 manifesto signed by Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo could be more easily chased from the web than the infectious jokes, games, and code words that circulate as memes through forums, chat rooms, and microblogs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWestern observers frequently imagine that any counter-censorship activity is necessarily insurgent. But in response to such thinking, such as a 2009 <i>New York Times</i> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/12/world/asia/12beast.html\">piece</a> on the <i>Grass mud horse</i> phenomenon, many Chinese commenters have asserted that the meme is more joke than protest. In English, <i>C\u01ceo N\u00ed M\u01ce</i> is literally a nonsense phrase, &ldquo;grass mud horse,&rdquo; but the homonym <i><a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/c%C3%A0o\">c\u00e0o</a> <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/n%C7%90\">n\u01d0</a> <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/m%C4%81\">m\u0101</a></i> (with different tones) translates to &ldquo;Fuck your mother.&rdquo; While Chinese private and public censors block obscene speech, arguing that pornography cohabitates with sedition, the phrase &ldquo;grass mud horse&rdquo; allowed netizens to curse with impunity.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOver time, the grass mud horse began to take on a new life beyond its function as a clever euphemism. A mythic creature depicted initially as a zebra, and then, more famously, as an alpaca, began to roam the web. In a host article posted on Wikipedia-analog Baidu Baike, several word games were strung together to describe a fantasy of liberation that was initially invisible to censors. It elaborated that the creature lives in a desert called Ma Le Ge Bi (which resembles another insult) and eats Wo Cao (literally &ldquo;fertile grass,&rdquo; but naturally resembling yet another profane outburst). \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMost saliently, the Cao Ni Ma was given a nemesis, the <i>h\u00e9xi\u00e8</i>, which literally means &ldquo;river crab&rdquo; but which was already established as a code word designed to elude censorship and police intervention. The near-homophonous word <i>h\u00e9xi\u00e9</i>, literally meaning &ldquo;harmony,&rdquo; was a loaded reference to the &ldquo;Harmonious Society&rdquo; doctrine of current president Hu Jintao, whose ostensible goal of fostering national unity serves as the mandate for the Chinese government&rsquo;s aggressive censorship policies. When netizens say that a user has been &ldquo;harmonized,&rdquo; the suggestion is that he or she has somehow been brought into compliance by government agents, whether by physical force or by blocking access to his or her account. The code word is a prudent adaptation, since no word is more suspect in a harmonious society than &ldquo;censorship.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe grass mud horse, both crude joke and poetic symbol of free speech, and the river crab, a symbol of censorship, allowed netizens to dramatize the conflict with censors without getting themselves &ldquo;harmonized.&rdquo; Most importantly, the modern myth of the grass mud horse&rsquo;s victory over the river crab was infectiously funny, allowing it to spread across the internet in shifting forms. For example, an online music video has a children&rsquo;s choir singing of the grass mud horse&rsquo;s exploits, as though to highlight the cuddly creature&rsquo;s unambiguous decency. Nature mockumentaries described the creature in its natural habitat. Finally, netizens began going out into the real world to visit alpacas at the zoo, posing with the grass mud horses and displaying the pictures on their blogs like a badge of honor. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEven well-established figures in the country&rsquo;s human rights movement have adopted internet memes as symbols for their struggle. Chinese artist Ai Weiwei has always held an ambiguous position between cooperation with the government and dissent. He served as an artistic consultant on the Beijing Olympics&rsquo; bird nest stadium, but he also undertook a number of art projects and documentaries critical of the government&rsquo;s human rights abuses, recently motivating the police to tear down his Shanghai studio. In tribute to the grass mud horse, Ai posted photos of himself on his website frolicking in the nude with a plush alpaca doll &ldquo;harmonizing&rdquo; his privates. The image both celebrates the grass mud horse&rsquo;s symbolic status as a champion of natural human freedom and evokes the constraints of censorship, as the artist protects himself from full exposure by using the grass mud horse as both a black bar and a perversely exaggerated phallus. Much like the phrase &ldquo;grass mud horse,&rdquo; Ai&rsquo;s alpaca doll announces what it obscures by replacing the unmentionable with a hysterical, unavoidable substitute.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/2/tom-brandon.jpg\" height=500 class=\"picture\"><br>Illustration by Tom Tian</center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn November 2010, Ai planned to host a banquet at which guests would feast on river crab in order to protest the announcement that his Shanghai studio would be demolished, possibly in retribution for his recent politically sensitive work. As the grass mud horse meme had done when it encouraged bloggers to publicly pose with a &ldquo;censored&rdquo; zoo animal, the river crab meme finally made the evolutionary leap from online avatar to real-world political banner. By this point, the river crab had become well known, and the Shanghai authorities contemplated shutting down the banquet. They ultimately settled on placing Ai under house arrest, so that he could not attend his own banquet. Like Liu Xiaobo at the Nobel ceremony, he was reserved a conspicuous seat in absentia.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe river crab and grass mud horse are now well-known political banners that attract government scrutiny. Allegedly, China chose to block domestic servers from YouTube in March 2009, in part to keep citizens from accessing popular grass mud horse videos. But part of what makes memes such an effective carrier of social malaise is precisely their ability to transform in order to hide themselves from the Chinese net&rsquo;s complex and ever-evolving immune system. As censors catch on to these tools of linguistic evasion, substitutes quickly evolve to take their place&mdash;for instance, shu\u01d0ch\u01cen, or &ldquo;aquatic product,&rdquo; sometimes takes the place of &ldquo;river crab&rdquo; as an allusion to censorship, sidestepping previous techniques of homonym-based linguistic evasion in favor of a different device, synonym. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to continue beneath the authorities&rsquo; dragnet, subversive memes need to change unpredictably. Netizens frequently alter the logic of their codes, deploying not only homonyms and synonyms to circumvent taboo subjects, but also a technique uniquely possible with Chinese logograms that lies somewhere in between cockney rhyming slang and avant-garde visual poetry. China&rsquo;s censorship-breakers have created neologisms like \u76ee\u7530, whose individual characters mean &ldquo;eye&rdquo; and &ldquo;field,&rdquo; by &ldquo;beheading&rdquo; the upper strokes of the outlawed words they stand in for. For instance, \u76ee\u7530 (or &ldquo;eye field&rdquo;) is formed by slicing the top off the word for freedom, \u81ea\u7531. Not only does the phrase permit the writer to articulate an expressed idea without attracting attention, but the neologism packs heavy symbolism for those who recognize the headless characters as victims of oppression&mdash;the censors have decapitated freedom in the pursuit of national harmony.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCrucial to their transmission is the pithy symbolism and dark humor contained in such code words. The memes mask progressive, if not necessarily revolutionary, power in their playful character, so that even many of their users appear to see them as functional tools, rather than compact protests. The world-recognized Charter 08 manifesto, a calculated and sustained call for human rights in China, does not take a digital approach to revolutionary politics, even though it was bravely transmitted in semi-public online media channels. Online jokers, whose protests require only a quick wit and a few keystrokes, may prove to have greater stamina, as they are constantly growing, and their tactics are ambiguous and evasive. To the world, Liu Xiaobo has become a symbol of both the revolutionary spirit and of the Chinese government&rsquo;s oppressive force. Though they have remained relatively unheralded, outlaw memes are a daily act of protest that go largely unpunished. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne internet meme that was developed to honor Liu behind the Great Firewall again plays with linguistic ambiguity, taking advantage of his common family name. Users on Twitter and other microblogging sites have paid tribute to Liu with posts that lead readers down the garden path to subversive thinking by describing a historically venerated individual with the last name Liu. These traditionally respected figures all have noncontroversial attributes in common with Liu Xiaobo, but only at the last minute does the blog writer reveal the &ldquo;true&rdquo; object of his or her appreciation. For instance, this post by wentommy pays homage to Liu Xuande (or Liu Bei), hero of the 14th-century epic <i>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</i>:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThe person I most admire has the surname Liu. He enjoys immense prestige among the common people, but is a thorn in the side of the powerful. He is known for his humanity and kindness, and even when insulted he endures it with tolerance. In times of distress he would give up his family before his morals, and faces danger willingly. But some have criticized him for fake humanity and false righteousness. His name is Liu....Xuande\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThese posts not only allow their writers to discretely honor a state criminal, but also show that Liu Xiaobo&rsquo;s character reaches across time to unite him with Chinese tradition, despite his status as a political prisoner. The posts suggest the universal humanity of resistance, and they honor Liu&rsquo;s timeless bravery and moral strength, rather than his specific actions. The meme appeals to the common character of individuals who stand up against moral wrongs to knock down the walls that keep dissenting voices behind bars and the virtual walls that exclude critical speech. The Great Firewall&rsquo;s virtual and human filters have made it impossible to honor a single man, but have inspired internet users to recognize commonality in his actions. Even the human censors might be moved to consider whether these posts are attacks on authority or innocent paeans to the national character.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the history of resistance to authoritarian power, China&rsquo;s online campaign for free speech is remarkable in that it takes advantage of unique possibilities of the Chinese language, as well as the technological possibilities of the internet. Unlike the extended metaphors of print-bound insurgencies, Chinese internet resistance aims for the kind of instant poignancy that generates further memes and leads to mass micro-movements. The online medium&rsquo;s challenges and opportunities inspire subversive memes. Operating in a semi-public space, online rallying cries can be heard by a wider audience than samizdats, crude graffiti, and furtive whispers, but they can also be efficiently tracked and dismantled. But by inciting outrage with a few characters, memes can pass by censors and turn jokes and profanities into unified protest.\r\n<img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nSince the rise of legal positivism, American law has been a system divorced from morality. According to the doctrine of legal positivism, whether or not a law is valid has nothing to do with whether or not it is moral. While moral and legal codes often overlap, this is more of a coincidental relationship than a causal one: many things that are morally wrong are also detrimental to smooth social functioning, and, as such, outlawed by the governing authority. On the other hand, many things that are wrong are well outside the legal purview, like being rude to a stranger, while many things that are morally neutral are illegal, like a twenty-year-old drinking a glass of wine at dinner with their parents. These are not examples of flaws in the legal system, at least not to one who accepts legal positivism: they are merely demonstrations of the fact that morality and legality are different.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLegal positivism was a great rupture in legal theory: centuries had been spent trying to make the law of man conform with a heavenly, divine, or perfect (and moral) law, and this pursuit was now abandoned in favor of a more &ldquo;practical&rdquo; approach. However, this great rupture in legal theory affected people&rsquo;s relationships with the law less than one might suppose, and although modern legal systems are not intended to approximate a moral code, people often relate to them as if they do. At the same time, however, Americans are quick to laud and embrace our many constitutionally protected freedoms, most of which are made possible by this very separation; freedom of speech and property rights are both things that could be impeded more easily by a moral law. (People reserve the right to do many things on private property that are morally questionable, and the right to tell lies when they are not in court.) So while happy with the results of legal positivism, people are nonetheless outraged by legislation on morally neutral (as opposed to immoral) acts, and often wish to see their moral codes enforced as law. This shapes their attitudes to breaking the law, what laws should be broken and when, and what acts should constitute breaking the law.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPeople break the law for many reasons: ignorance, malice, laziness, convenience, to name a few. However, people also sometimes break the law with a sense of moral self-righteousness, as an act, however trivial, of standing up against &ldquo;the man.&rdquo; While this moral stance is generally a justification of and not the impetus for the illegal act (unlike, say, an illegal violent protest specifically targeted at a law), it is nonetheless an example of the way in which people cast their relationship to the law in ethical light. People in these circumstances break laws as a way of acting out against what they see as governmental morality, and to make a statement of what <i>they</i> think is right. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor example, when hardcore natural food enthusiasts attend clandestine raw milk bartering sessions, they do so without a sense of moral guilt (and rightly so!): there is nothing wrong, morally speaking, with unpasteurized milk products, and there is usually nothing wrong with them in terms of health. Many people involved with raw milk feel that this absence of moral wrongness\u2014combined with the fact that raw milk is better for the environment and, according to some, for your health\u2014justifies their illegal act, and they feel extremely indignant when the FBI shows up to shut them down. While this does seem extravagant on the part of the FBI, knowing that your actions are not <i>wrong</i> does not mean your acts are not legitimately illegal. The law that forbids raw milk in New York state might well be totally silly, but that does not make it an immoral law, and, however natural it is to feel morally outraged when your local illegal raw milk coop gets shut down (&lsquo;we were doing nothing <i>wrong!</i>&rsquo;), this outrage is not strictly reasonable. The counterintuitive fact of the matter is that something can easily be illegal without being wrong, as laws no longer derive their legitimacy from morality. While the legislature can be mistaken as to expediency and good sense, the laws it makes are not usually moral judgments and cannot be disagreed with as if they were.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is important to note here that laws, though they are not moral by nature, can still be morally wrong, and in these cases, resistance to them is an important and necessary step. When a law either outlaws a moral act or requires an immoral act, like returning someone who has escaped from slavery to their purported owner, it can be morally wrong. By and large, however, laws are not moral legislation, and the simple fact that a law forbids a morally neutral act does not make that law immoral. Laws against jaywalking or feeding pigeons, for example, are not morally wrong laws in the way that Jim Crow laws were wrong; rather, they are laws of exclusively practical, and not moral, content. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nNonetheless, laws are understood (or rather misunderstood) in moral terms throughout society. I have already discussed how people justify their illegal acts by explaining that their actions were not morally wrong, and thus somehow less forbidden, or at least less justifiably forbidden. In fact, amorality (or lack of moral content, as in, the &lsquo;legal&rsquo; option is not superior morally to the &lsquo;illegal&rsquo; option) in law is the norm, and chaos would ensue if people felt free to break any law that didn&rsquo;t match up with their moral code (think of obeying traffic laws). We also see the opposite effect: just as people object to the outlawing of acts with no immoral content (like the purchase and consumption of raw milk), they also object to the legality of acts that are morally wrong (like lying to a friend) but not against the law. This is another symptom of the tendency to see laws and morality as identical, if debatable and negotiable, codes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis, dare I say, universal desire to outlaw that which is wrong (a desire suppressed by legal positivists, but not suppressed by all) has resulted in vice laws, legislation banning sex acts, and other attempts to render one group or another&rsquo;s moral code into law. It is all too easy to assume this desire is the preserve of the religious right and the &lsquo;values voters&rsquo;; I argue that it is an inclination we all share, however our values may differ. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/2/wesley-alice.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br>Illustration by Wesley Ryan Clapp</center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTake the recent case of the Westboro Baptist Church, the Kansas fundamentalist hate group known for protesting at soldiers&rsquo; funerals. It is difficult not to want their acts of extreme emotional cruelty to recently bereaved people to be illegal, even if one understands why they are not or cannot be under our legal system. It is easy to sympathize with the pain and suffering of the deceased&rsquo;s father: most of us would be sickened by having a loved one&rsquo;s funeral overshadowed by inflammatory anti-gay anti-Catholic anti-America propaganda, and many of us were angry just hearing about it. Nonetheless, the opinion of the Fourth Circuit Court, upheld by the Supreme Court, was that their protest, though morally wrong, was legal and protected under the First Amendment. Justice Alito, dissenting from the opinion of the court, referred to Mr. Snyder (the plaintiff, and father of the dead soldier) as having &ldquo;the right of any parent who experiences such an incalculable loss: to bury his son in peace.&rdquo; However, this is really more of a moral right than a legal right. Alito goes on to specify that it is an &ldquo;elementary right,&rdquo; presumably to defend himself from the criticism that nowhere in the Bill of Rights, for example, can the right to bury offspring in peace be found. His phrasing also serves to remind (most of) us that we do believe it&rsquo;s wrong to bother or torment someone in such a circumstance. The rest of Alito&rsquo;s colleagues, while acknowledging the enraging and immoral nature of the protest, still upheld it as legal. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo it seems that the law exists in some sort of morality limbo. Many people, including some judges and legislators, interact with it as with a moral law, or attempt to legislate morality. However, their interpretation of law as a vehicle of morality is problematic, given both the stated separation between law and morality assumed by our entire system of law since the rise of legal positivism, and the fact that most of our laws exist for practical reasons rather than moral ones. If we want our current legal system to legislate morality, we must first accept most of our current laws as moral; however, any system of ethics that held parking in a no parking zone by accident to be wrong would be extremely odd and deeply flawed. Already, people defend impolite or even immoral actions by saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a free country,&rdquo; as though legality were a sufficient moral justification for an action.  Our systemic confusion about the relationship between law and morality, in which we want the legality of an action to correspond to its morality, does not seem to negatively affect our morality but merely confounds our legal understanding. Defining the moral by the legal, however, would so dilute the concept of morality as to make it practically devoid of meaning. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPerhaps the moral fatigue of living in a pluralistic society, surrounded by many competing ethical systems, makes us long to turn to legislation as the master source of what is right and wrong. When we do this, consciously or unconsciously, we are inevitably disappointed in the law. A great many of these disappointments stem from the fact that we are looking for something that is not there: a coherent moral code. This disappointment is, in my opinion, to the greater good: as long as we are disappointed by law when we try to read it ethically, one hopes we will be less likely to mistake it for a moral code. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

Established on private land by a small group of South African citizens, the village is a bastion of memory for its 800 residents, within which they have attempted to recreate a failed 20th-century sociopolitical experiment architected by the man whose statue overlooks the town square.  That man was H. F. Verwoerd, and that experiment was apartheid, arguably the most brutal and sustained violation of human rights since World War II.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough Orania maintains a somewhat isolationist policy due to its decidedly awkward status in modern South Africa, I was given the opportunity to interview the residents of Orania and its leaders in order to study the realignment of the South African white identity after apartheid.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p> \r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p> \r\nApartheid is often misunderstood, by Americans in particular, as a system of segregation not unlike that in the pre-Civil Rights southern United States.  In reality, apartheid was an absolute, undeniably fascist, fully compartmentalized system in which arbitrarily designated racial groups were not only relegated to separate citizenships, but operated within separate economies, polities, and juridical systems.  (In one telling example, at one time during apartheid there were ten separate departments of education\u2014one for each \u201crace,\u201d and one for each dependent \u201chomeland\u201d territory.) The Afrikaners were a white, Dutch Calvinist population that settled in South Africa in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and developed their own linguistic, ethnic and cultural heritage, so much so that by the time of the British colonization in the nineteenth century it was the Afrikaners, not the native African populations, who put up the most resistance to British rule. Apartheid\u2019s underlying philosophy was born of the political determination of the Afrikaners.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Afrikaner dream of an independent <i>volkstaat</i> (\u201cpeople\u2019s state\u201d) was delayed during the period of British colonization. It had to wait until 1948, when the National Party came to power. Its first order of business was the attempted establishment of a utopian, linguistically and culturally pure Afrikaans nation, in a political system that came to be known as apartheid.  In 1960, Verwoerd, then Prime Minister, tried to fulfill the Afrikaner dream of full independence by separating from the British Commonwealth and establishing the Republic of South Africa.<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup> \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIncreasing international isolation and internal demands for reform led to the demise of apartheid, and in 1994 the new multi-racial and multi-party democracy promulgated a new constitution that outlawed racism and guaranteed recognition of all South African ethnic identities. The new constitution offered many oppressed South African ethnic groups, such as the Zulu and Xhosa, who had been relegated to poverty and insignificance in the \u201cnative\u201d homelands set up during apartheid, the opportunity to practice their linguistic and cultural heritage freely, and participate in the South African democratic project as equal citizens.  But for some, like the Afrikaners, this constitutional provision was necessary to allay their fears of post-apartheid marginalization.  After their protected status under apartheid ended, they feared the loss of their national and linguistic identity as they suddenly became a disempowered minority.  Although most Afrikaners adapted to the transition by embracing non-racialism as an essential component of the new national order, some felt a compelling urge to entrench themselves further in the land, reaffirming their belief that Afrikanerdom constituted a culturally distinct and uncompromisingly African heritage.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEnter Carel Boshoff, grandson-in-law of Verwoerd himself, who, along with his wife and 30 Afrikaner farmers, professors, missionaries and clergy\u2014and along with Verwoerd\u2019s 92-year-old widow\u2014spent half a million dollars on a ghost town in the Northern Cape to found Orania in 1993.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOrania, as a <a href=\"http://www.info.gov.za/documents/constitution/1996/96cons14.htm#235\">constitutionally legal</a> self-governing entity with its own currency, banks, schools, and farms, occupies a fascinating position in the new South Africa: a group of Afrikaners, wishing to extend the nationalist project of apartheid, created a self-determined nation unto themselves, by citing their constitutional right to cultural advancement.  Indeed, Oranians are overwhelmingly, if not unanimously, conservative Afrikaners who support a return to the ideals of Verwoerd and apartheid.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat sentiment in itself is not surprising.  What is surprising is the nostalgia of these Afrikaner purists as it relates to their own self-determination.  Frequently the residents express discontent over the \u201csapping of Afrikaner identity\u201d and their fears of marginalization in the new South Africa, and they suggest that the Afrikaner ideal could be lost due to \u201cAfrikaner pragmatism.\u201d  Observed Carel Boshoff IV, the grandson of Orania\u2019s founder, \u201cWhat was once a resolute community that demanded respect has now developed into a loose bundle of individuals that totter between nostalgia and opportunism.\u201d However, Oranians do not consider themselves to be victims, but cultural crusaders who seized the opportunity of the transition to found a self-determined community of proactive, proud Afrikaners.  Oranians hope to practice Afrikanerdom in all its purest linguistic, racial, religious and cultural forms free of outside molestation.  Only Afrikaans is spoken, the only church is the Dutch Reformed Church, and no non-Afrikaners are allowed to live in Orania\u2014not even white, English-speaking South Africans (unless they identify as Afrikaner).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe community, to them, is not about racism but about the continuance of Afrikanerdom as a legitimate cultural project. They see themselves therefore less as racial purists than as cultural purists, and view their town very much as a bastion of Afrikaner purity.  Said one Oranian teacher:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nOrania\u2019s growth depends to a large extent on the situation in the rest of the country. If Afrikaners feel threatened in [South Africa] Orania will grow quicker, but fear should not be the driving force for people to move to Orania\u2014neither racism. Orania cannot be seen as a place to escape\u2014it may not be a negative action, but proactive and a positive challenge.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nFurthermore, Oranians are surprisingly willing to engage in the national political discourse.  They consider themselves to be citizens of South Africa, and are proud of the Afrikaner contribution to its history.  Most moved to Orania because of what they perceived to be their victimization by the government when it came to employment, and fear of white-targeted crime. (It is a matter of debate among scholars whether the high crime rate in South Africa disproportionately targets whites.) They take a stance against the assertion that Afrikanerdom is merely a racial identity, and defend their right to exist in a closed community. Finally, they believe that living in such communities should be a goal of most South Africans.  Said an Oranian engineer:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nTrue peace can only be found in the co-existence of the different peoples of South Africa. If each group can find peace with themselves and peace with their neighbors then South Africa will be a good place to live in. You can only found peace with yourself if you respect your own identity and be prepared to protect it. The only way to protect it is to group with your own people.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThis sentiment is echoed by another resident, who told me:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nYes, I think there should be more towns like Orania, as we are a bit far from our families, I would say, one Orania-type town in every province, maybe. No, never will the whole of SA ever be like Orania, as it is a rainbow nation, but to have a few places <i>for each nationality</i> in and around SA where your own culture is kept, will be a good idea, I think. [emphasis mine]\r\n</blockquote>\r\nCertainly, this concept is nothing new\u2014apartheid itself was an experiment in \u201cBantustaning,\u201d the practice of allotting land to different ethnic groups.  The Bantustans were legally treated much in the same way that American Indian reservations are today\u2014separate governments, with little to no assistance from the apartheid government. The Bantustans, which date back to the 1913 Natives\u2019 Land Act, were the government\u2019s solution to the problem of the black majority. By giving them \u201chomelands,\u201d it was hoped a large-scale demographic catastrophe would be averted.  The Oranian position, for this reason, has been challenged by South Africans who reject separatism and see echoes of the racist apartheid project in Orania.  Orania has been criticized by many South Africans for being a racist enclave and continuing to support and teach apartheid-era ideas.  One professor observed that the ruling African National Congress (ANC) opposes places like Orania because it fears a trend toward the Bantustaning of South Africa.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat is to be made of this group of rural settlers whose primary goal is the continuation of an apartheid system in the face of overwhelming national opposition?  Are they to be celebrated for their commitment to a nationalist cause, or ridiculed for their refusal to assimilate into an increasingly democratized South Africa?  Are they politicized?  Whom do they represent, if more than just themselves?  And finally, are they merely racists?  Or do they represent a complex identity crisis, where whites have been forced to reexamine their own conceptions of themselves?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhite introspection is not a peculiarly Afrikaner phenomenon in post-apartheid South Africa.  It is a common discursive theme in the collective white experience, drawing from feelings of inadequacy and hopelessness in the new regime.  After apartheid, the white identity in the new South Africa is no longer seen as a specifically racial concept, but as representing a complex relationship between culture and class. Whites have experienced a dismantling of their own worldview, a correction in their previously assumed conception of themselves.  In response, many have created an environment of collectivism tied to a common history, in an attempt to legitimize whiteness as a compelling identity.  The narrative of whiteness has become one of separation, of delegitimization.  In other words, whites have finally had to come face-to-face with their minorityhood.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor Afrikaners, the identity crisis gains another level of complexity.  Afrikaners have always had a strong conception of their own national heritage, born of religious persecution, anti-colonial resistance, rugged pioneering, and entrepreneurship.  They were the first European settlers in South Africa, and they feel the same right to their country as white Australians feel to theirs. The deconstruction of apartheid, to most South Africans (including white non-Afrikaners), was the deconstruction of a racist aberration; for many Afrikaners, it was the deconstruction of a dream of independence and self-determination.  Thus, many Afrikaners have been unable to adjust to their new post-apartheid minorityhood, but instead have found themselves to be a shadow in search of a form\u2014a stark contrast to the previous regime, where the definition and elaboration of an Afrikaner national identity was an accepted dogma of state policy.  In this search for recognition as a new minority, they have been met by a hostile South Africa that cares more about lifting the disenfranchised masses out of desolation than protecting a privileged few.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThus it is not particularly surprising that since apartheid, a sentiment has emerged among Afrikaners that racism, while still very much active, has been turned on its head.  A 2009 documentary, \u201cPoor Whites/Rich Blacks,\u201d depicts a poor Afrikaner family faced with the realities of the new South Africa.  The man tells the interviewer that apartheid still exists, but in reverse:  \u201cYes, we were in the good position, that was apartheid.  Now it\u2019s the opposite, but it is still apartheid.\u201d The conception of \u201creverse apartheid\u201d has become a rallying cry for Afrikaners.  One Afrikaner wrote:  \u201cI continue to be against it [apartheid], also now that the role players have been swapped around and the policy of race differentiation is being labeled \u2018affirmative action.\u2019  Under the policy of apartheid, particularly the Afrikaners sought to obtain certain privileges and protection for themselves.  Today the black majority seeks to do likewise.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nThe use of the term \u201cnew apartheid\u201d is particularly controversial because it draws an equivalency that is not historically or sociologically accurate.  However, it is a common theme in interview responses from Afrikaners, especially those in Orania, to state their objection to the apartheid system, then draw a moral equivalency between apartheid victimization and their own experience.  In doing so, they hope to legitimate their own position. It does not follow that white racism and black racism are morally equivalent, or that the white \u201cvictims\u201d of the new order occupy the same historical position as their black counterparts.  The compulsive desire to be sympathetic while simultaneously apologetic is reflective of a new type of white identity characteristic of the new South Africa, which has become ideologically linked with the persecution ethos of previous generations.  Within the Afrikaner pro-nationalist and pro-white historiography, South Africa has always been a land of racial conflict, from the natives to the English, and now from black nationalism to black power.  Thus, while it is hardly possible to demonstrate a moral equivalence between white racism and black racism, there may nonetheless be a relationship between the white fear of marginalization and the black fear of marginalization.  Certainly this undercurrent runs through Afrikaner discourse on their experience, and it has permeated the modern Afrikaner society, causing it to reevaluate its own status in a post-apartheid world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMany Afrikaners feel that to see evidence of their victimization, they need look no further than the systematic dismantling of Afrikaner institutions and linguistic heritage after apartheid.  This was a bilateral process:  not only did Afrikaner influence in government, education, and law wane, but after apartheid, Afrikaans-language publications, Afrikaans-identified businesses, and traditionally Afrikaans-identified political parties started to downplay their Afrikaner roots and integrate with mainstream society.  Afrikaans festivals and cultural organizations saw a drop in funding, and the previously unabashedly Afrikaner bank, Volkskas, diluted its stake in Afrikanerdom by making the first \u201cblack empowerment\u201d deal, courting Coloured management and selling its insurance policies to majority non-Afrikaner customers.  Even the National Party, whose roots lay solidly in Afrikanerdom, disassociated with Afrikaners in an attempt to form new coalitions, notably merging with the ruling ANC in 2005.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, despite a persistent fear among most Afrikaners in South Africa about delegitimization, Orania is one of only a couple such Afrikaner enclaves in the country, suggesting that on the whole, most Afrikaners participate in civil society and seek to protect their interests through the democratic process within public, diversified communities.  This phenomenon is nowhere more apparent than in the activities of AfriForum, a major white advocacy group.  Its charter draws heavily from the post-apartheid South African constitution and stresses the importance of minority rights vis-\u00e0-vis the rights of the majority, a common theme in the philosophy of liberal democracy.  AfriForum\u2019s commitment to the democratic process and its belief in the constitutionalism of the new South Africa legitimizes the organization, allowing it to be accepted, if begrudgingly, not as a fringe group seeking extremist or racist goals but as a lobbying group interested in advancing the interests of the white minority.  (AfriForum is currently embroiled in a national controversy over the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/world/africa/01southafrica.html\">hate speech trial</a> of Julius Malema, president of the African National Congress Youth League, who has been criticized for his use at rallies of the apartheid-era fight song \u201cKill the Boer, Kill the Farmer,\u201d which has been used in the past to incite violence against Afrikaner farmers.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfriForum\u2019s foremost concern, according to their literature, is the \u201capathetic withdrawal\u201d of whites into their own political disenfranchisement, which leads to further non-involvement and lack of influence in the political process.  In describing this apathy, they refer not just to the citizens of Orania, but to the attitude of the white minority in general, which they feel is a victim of its introspection as well as that of the ruling majority.  They advocate a \u201cCome Home\u201d campaign, seeking to bring disaffected whites back to South Africa, and a campaign \u201cfor the protection and consolidation of civil rights,\u201d which seeks to address specific policy points in the new race discourse, including employment inequity and crime.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAre Oranians merely racists?  Indeed, many Oranians admit, even insist, that they are racists.  However, the point of divergence with mainstream society, observed one foreign reporter, occurs when they insist that \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with racism.\u201d The society of Orania has coalesced around a modern, and virulent, sort of racist white exclusivity\u2014it is a way of life.  However, unlike their white counterparts in the rest of South Africa, who live their lives in a \u201cbubble\u201d within a sea of black labor, whites in Orania do all of the work themselves.  As a British journalist observed, \u201cIt\u2019s not a photo opportunity in Britain to snap a white person holding a spade.  For Afrikaners\u2014hell, most of white South Africa\u2014it\u2019s a shock.\u201d Orania can be viewed as a microcosm of the newfound white identity in South Africa, where racism lives on, but where new expectations regarding racial roles are being accepted.  The racism of the people of Orania is almost a nostalgic throwback to an earlier era, to which they cling to retain cultural legitimacy.  However, unlike some right-wing Afrikaner reactionaries who seek to dismantle the new democracy using violence, Oranians seem to be content living their lives in their cultural bubble, seemingly without ill will toward the larger South African state, with most actively participating in national elections as supporters of the Freedom Front Plus (FFP) party.  As one resident told me, \u201cI don't mind being part of South Africa and having a loyalty toward the country as long as it does not mean that I have to sacrifice my own identity as Afrikaner.\u201d  Greater South Africa has not been as hostile as might be expected toward this community:  Nelson Mandela, Julius Malema, and current president Jacob Zuma have all visited Orania.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nSo one has to ask:  is it not so much a return to apartheid they crave, but a return to cultural independence?  Is it minority rule they seek, or minority acceptance?  Maybe in their search for their own apartheid, they hope to capture what control they can achieve:  self-determination, self-government, and, if possible, self-respect.  However, many Oranians hope that such a system will one day be unnecessary, and they can live in a greater South Africa free of the burdens of the past.  One of my respondents wrote:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nIf there were ANY cure for this ugly mess in our lovely country called crime or violence, the necessity for an Orania would not have happened, as we are not people for hatred, fights and murders, no, no, no, we are loving people, that would only like a place in the sun, and a haven for our children and old people, where we can live like normal people, and not locked up in our houses that became our jails! If ever there is a cure for all of this, please let us know, and we will implement it immediately, so that we can have a SAFE and LOVELY SOUTH AFRICA again, which we love so much! Where else can we go, where can we hide, nowhere, so we will just have to stay, and pray to our Lord that all will end well!\r\n</blockquote>\r\nIt is hard to see these residents as anything but the people they have become:  a minority\u2014now perhaps an unprotected minority\u2014who feel, sincerely, that their salvation will come not in their assimilation but in their separation.  They do not view themselves as whites: that is a racial identity they would rather subordinate to their Afrikaner heritage.  Instead, their very definition of Afrikanerdom is intertwined with their idea of cultural uniqueness, of rugged individualism, and above all else resistance to domination. As one of my respondents wrote,\r\n<blockquote>\r\nWhat is an Afrikaner?  To be proud of your heritage as a group of people that was forced out of their original mother country, to regroup in a foreign continent, and to build a community with strong Christian living norms, create their own language and norms and use it to better the living conditions not only of themselves but also the other people of South Africa.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThe question today for the residents of Orania is how they can reconcile their new identity with a new nation that is also striving to identify itself\u2014how they can be reabsorbed into the new South African identity without losing their own. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\">\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nIt goes without saying that a true <i>volkstaat</i> never did\u2014and never could\u2014exist in South Africa.  This is both because 80% of the population was non-white and because half of the white population was English-speaking non-Afrikaners, who were needed to form a white power coalition.\r\n</p>\r\n",

Not to the future\u2014the future bored me\u2014but always to the past. Sometimes I dreamed I was a pioneer, traveling west in a covered wagon; sometimes I was a stowaway on ship, catching a ride with Captain Cook. Sometimes, after a round with <i>The Sound of Music</i>, I dreamed that I was a girl-spy in the Resistance. This particular fantasy became so vivid that I started to dream in sleepy earnest of roving Nazis who hunted me on streetcars and staircases. When my mother found out about these nightmares, she banished <i>The Sound of Music</i> from our house for six or seven months. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching that movie too much,\u201d she told me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe girl-spy scenario was no great loss, for it was only a bauble in my treasure chest of daydreams. The real gold lay elsewhere, in a very particular historical place and time: Boston, simmering with sedition on the eve of the American Revolution. I dreamed that scenario six ways from Sunday. Every place an eight-year-old girl could conceivably find herself in Revolutionary-era Boston, I went, and then to a lot of other places besides. I was a courier for the Sons of Liberty; I was a farm girl in Concord; I was a girl who pretended to be a boy so she could enlist in the Continental Army. I was the brave daughter or plucky apprentice of just about every Founding Father from New England. (I was also, by necessity, extremely progressive about 18th-century gender roles.) \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy daydreams were intricately plotted and vividly detailed, and they were a joy to me. Not so much because I reveled in escape from my daily life, but because I hungered to experience another kind of life altogether. For as long as I could remember, I had been captivated by stories of the Revolutionary War. Whence this interest arose, I don\u2019t know; perhaps someone told me a rollicking good version of the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere when I was five or six, and I took it too deeply to heart. As I grew a little older, I read voraciously about the era, collecting enough material to make myself a first-class nuisance in any conversation. But I was enchanted by this drama of patriotism and intrigue. How strange a time it was, and how unutterably exciting! I yearned to play a part.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor a while, I believed I really could. I knew my daydreams for what they were, pure fantasy. But for an eight-year-old girl, the world is still a somewhat magical place, and the laws governing it are not entirely clear. Was time travel possible? Well, no; but neither did it seem possible that I should possess such a powerful desire to travel back in time, without the universe would consent to satisfy me. Although I had no clear expectations for how things would play out, still I think I was waiting for something extraordinary to happen to me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo my profound disappointment, nothing extraordinary did happen. What happened instead was this: one morning during my fourth grade year, as I was sitting at the kitchen table with my breakfast bowl of oatmeal, I lost my faith. I was probably daydreaming about being Abigail \r\nAdams\u2019s kitchen maid (oatmeal tending to inspire such fantasies), when all of a sudden I was struck with a fit of pique. How frustrating it was, to daydream so diligently and yet have nothing come of it! I wanted so much to go in body where I went in my mind\u2019s eye. I must have been in a masochistic mood, because I decided to bait myself. \u201cCharlotte,\u201d I thought, \u201cyou must realize now that you will never be able to go back in time. It will never happen, because it is not possible.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat was it. Though I had meant only to spar with my own frustration, I somehow heard that dreadful speech and knew it was true. I was never going to be able to go back in time. It was not possible. I remember dropping my spoon into the bowl of rapidly-cooling oatmeal (so long, Abigail Adams) and staring at the tablecloth, trying not to cry. It seems silly to say now, but in that moment I felt I had sustained an awful loss. \r\n</p> \r\n \r\n<p>\r\n<h3>2</h3>\r\n<h3>Historical memory</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMuch has changed since that fateful breakfast\u2014the future now scares me instead of boring me\u2014but my appetite for some kind of immediate knowledge of the past has not abated. As a child, I paired this appetite with a craving for personal adventure. I wanted not only to know about history, but to enact it myself. There is something fundamentally immature about this urge; as if history were a great big amusement park, and I a happy-go-lucky tourist working my way through all the rides. \u201cThe Civil War\u2014what a roller coaster that was! Thank God I got off before anyone was killed.\u201d Eventually I graduated from this perspective, but never from my initial fascination. Though I have long since stopped imagining myself as an historical actor, I still want to know <i>what it was like then</i>, to see history in rich, sensory detail, as lucidly as I perceive my own present.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nIn me this desire is perhaps extreme, but we all harbor something like it. Someone mentions the Great Depression, and our minds call up a catalogue of images: breadlines, shantytowns, migrant families. Someone mentions the Civil Rights Movement, and we see Martin leading a march or Malcolm at a lectern. Different people may conjure different images, but we all imagine something. Let us call this animation of history by image or story historical memory.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat exactly is historical memory? The term has many different meanings, but it generally refers to a group\u2019s common understanding of a shared past.  Historians usually use the more precise \u201ccollective memory,\u201d a phrase coined by philosopher, sociologist, and Frenchman Maurice Halbwachs. Halbwachs distinguished between two faculties of memory, individual and collective. \u201cSuppose,\u201d wrote he, \u201cthat remembrances are organized in two ways, either grouped about a definite individual who considers them from his own viewpoint or distributed within a group for which each is a partial image.\u201d The former is individual memory, which manages the experiences of one\u2019s personal life. The latter is collective memory, a unitary collection of facts, ideas, stories, and images related to a group\u2019s history and maintained in fragments by individuals within the group. Each person contributes his shard of memory to the larger picture. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo runs the classical conception of historical memory. But how does an individual experience this amalgamation of memories? Can a single person view the group\u2019s larger picture? Or, to put the question a different way: how can one person recall with the quality of memory, not knowledge, something that she herself never experienced? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAccording to Halbwachs, a sort of memory-by-proxy is possible, but only through laborious appropriation. To recall the past in any coherent way, he writes, \r\n<blockquote>\r\nI must rely entirely upon the memory of others, a memory that comes, not as corroborator or completer of my own, but as the very source of what I wish to repeat [...] I carry a baggage load of historical remembrances that I can increase through conversation and reading. But it remains a borrowed memory, not my own. \r\n</blockquote>\r\nHalbwachs\u2019s \u201cbaggage load\u201d of memory contains only the historical events that he has actually lived through. In his schema, I might borrow a memory of Barack Obama\u2019s election, but I could not borrow one of Warren Harding\u2019s (and really, who would want to?). Still, the notion of borrowed memory seems full of possibility. Groups remember what they have reason to care for; in Halbwachs\u2019s words, what has \u201cinterested and transformed\u201d them. But what of transformations begun long ago, but still interesting to the present? For example, though I did not live through the Great Depression, that era has deeply influenced the conditions of my life. May I not borrow \u201cthrough conversation and reading\u201d a memory of those times, much as I borrow memories of things that have happened in my own time, but which I have not witnessed? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf I may not, someone will have to confiscate my Studs Terkel anthology. <i>Hard Times</i>, a collection of Terkel\u2019s oral histories about the Great Depression, is easy pickings for an acquisitive memory. Terkel\u2019s interviews are so direct, so full of strange and stunning detail, that they populate my thoughts as vividly as my own recollections do. Here is an excerpt from an interview with farmer Harry Terrel, recounting an attack on an Iowa judge who was involved with foreclosures on farm mortgages during a period of unrest:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nIt all happened in Le Mars. They took the judge out of his court and took him to the fairgrounds and they had a rope around his neck, and they had the rope over the limb of the tree. They were gonna string him up in the old horse thief fashion. But somebody had sense enough to stop the thing before it got too far.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThere is much that is murky about this memory. Who was the judge? How did the mob collect him? And why didn\u2019t they go through with the hanging? Harry Terrel doesn\u2019t tell us. But with an economy of language he conjures a scene that is devastatingly immediate. \u201cThey had a rope around his neck, and they had the rope over the limb of the tree\u201d: that image is as clear as day, and imminently disturbing. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith a good narrator like Harry Terrel, it is easy to see how we might borrow memories of things we never saw. But where such a voice is absent, how can we supply memory to history? I have had some good luck with this question recently, mulling over a bit of history in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I live. Cambridge is a proud keeper of its history, and the jewel in its crown is George Washington. Washington spent only nine months in the city, but he has spawned an astonishing proliferation of plaques and monuments. A hotel near the Cambridge Commons, part of the Sheraton chain, actually styles itself the Sheraton Commander in his honor. An enormous, red, neon sign reading \u201cThe Commander\u201d sits atop its roof, and its entrance is graced by a statue of Washington, who is identified simply as \u201cThe Commander.\u201d In the lobby there is a diorama of Washington reviewing his troops. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe troops in question are, of course, the Continental Army, part of which was garrisoned at Cambridge in 1775 and 1776 while the army laid siege to British troops in Boston. The siege began in the aftermath of the battles at Lexington and Concord and ended in the spring of 1776, when the American troops installed heavy artillery on the hills overlooking Boston and put the British troops to flight (to Canada, wouldn\u2019t you know). Boston and Cambridge still celebrate the anniversary of the British departure as a public holiday.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWashington oversaw the siege beginning in July 1775, when he arrived in Cambridge under orders from the revolutionary coalition to take charge of its army. The next nine months were a terrible trial. The army, at its best a rather disorganized collection of local and state militias, began to disintegrate. Soldiers slipped home to become farmers again, and they took their weapons with them. Money and ammunition, always in short supply, ran so low that Washington feared he would not be able to resist if the British moved on his camp. Significant offensive action could not be thought of with so few men and so little shot; of Henry Knox, who had been dispatched in the late fall to retrieve artillery from Fort Ticonderoga, there was no word. \u201cIf I shall be able to rise superior to these, and many other difficulties which might be enumerated,\u201d Washington wrote that winter, \u201cI shall most religiously believe that the finger of Providence is in it, to blind the eyes of our enemies.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDuring these months, Washington had his headquarters in a large house outside Harvard Square, overlooking the Charles River. The troops stationed in Cambridge had set up their camps on the Cambridge Commons and in Harvard Yard. I walk past these places almost every day (the lilacs at Washington\u2019s headquarters are in splendid bloom this week), and I have often tried to picture how they must have looked in that first winter of the war. I have read no very vivid accounts of the period, certainly nothing with Harry Terrel\u2019s punch. But in the absence of any good memories to borrow, I have begun to contemplate the land itself. I am trying to imagine it without trees. Though Cambridge is now a verdant city, almost all of its trees date from after the siege. At that time, New England had been teetering on the edge of widespread fuel shortages for decades, and the sudden influx of soldiers into Cambridge that winter precipitated a crisis. American troops cut down most public and many private woodlots for fuel and even began to strip orchards, houses, and fences to burn. Still there was not enough wood. Washington was in a terrible bind. He worried that if the army were not adequately supplied, it would disperse at the first bad weather; yet he could not permit the troops to collect their fuel from private property. \u201cFrom fences to forest trees, and from forest trees to fruit trees, is a natural advance to houses, which must next follow,\u201d he fretted. Even more alarming was the potential for violence among the troops as they jockeyed for supplies. \u201cI little thought we had scarce four hours [of fuel yesterday],\u201d he wrote the Continental Congress in November 1775, \u201cand that different Regiments were upon the point of cutting each others\u2019 throats for a few standing locusts near their encampment to dress their victuals with.\u201d<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup> \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe eighteenth century is still foreign enough that I cannot quite picture the scene Washington described. Harry Terrel\u2019s mob of farmers was familiar-looking to me, all things considered, but I have no visual vocabulary for the clothes or tools of Washington\u2019s soldiers. I can, however, begin to imagine how barren and apocalyptic a New England landscape without trees must have appeared. Now when I cross the Commons, I sometimes squint and try to call to mind a memory of that grim view.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/4/tom-charlotte.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Tom Tian</i></center></p> \r\n<p>\r\n<h3>3</h3>\r\n<h3>Our moral stupidity</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt the last, what are memories of history good for? Like all exercises of imagination, they can run dangerously amok. Individual memory, at least, is founded in lived experience; but the production of historical memory, which does not have even this weak check, can turn out very badly. General George S. Patton, an Allied commander in World War II, cherished historical memories that verged on delusions. He did not borrow memories so much as he stole them. So vivid was Patton\u2019s imagination and so suggestible were his metaphysics, he came to believe that he himself had fought in some of the great military campaigns of history, from Rome\u2019s conquest of Carthage to Napoleon\u2019s sweep through Europe. \u201cI wonder if I could have been here before,\u201d he wrote his mother from France in 1917. \u201cAs I drive up the Roman road the Theater seems familiar\u2014perhaps I headed a legion up that same white road and wiped the dust from eyes while thanking Jupiter for the promised bath.\u201d Patton and my eight-year-old self would have had a lot to talk about, for his memories of life as a Roman centurion are rather like my own daydreams of Revolutionary soldiery. But instead of growing out of these daydreams, Patton burrowed more deeply into them, and acquired a case of full-fledged megalomania along the way. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo Patton was a little crazy, but at least it wasn\u2019t catching. Worse by far are history\u2019s sentimentalizers, those people who elide unpleasant passages of history to accommodate their own sepia-toned fantasies. This abuse is cousin to Patton\u2019s: both spring from an unhealthy attachment to the past. But whereas Patton\u2019s delusions concerned no one but himself (perhaps his mother was a bit concerned, too), the sentimentalizers of historical memory often clump together in unsightly groups. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor an example of this mischief, look to the Lost Cause of the Confederacy. The Lost Cause is an alarmingly popular movement in historical memory that distorts the history of the American Civil War in service of nostalgia for the antebellum South. In an effort to redeem and celebrate the Confederacy, the movement promulgates an account of the conflict that is sometimes sophistical and often flatly false. The Lost Cause narrative is most inaccurate\u2014and most dangerous\u2014in its sanitization of the South as a slave society, and in its cognitively-dissonant denial of the role that slavery and racism played in Southern life and the Southern cause. This ideology is rooted in a pernicious kind of memory, one that suffers from a fatal attraction to a flawed past. In order to make history habitable for fantasy, Lost Causers simply ignore the historical evidence.<sup><a name=\"id2\" href=\"#ft2\">2</a></sup>  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFrom the examples above we may deduce two rules for the practice of historical memory. First, historical memory is not a substitute for historical knowledge. The latter consists of a familiarity with historical facts and with rigorous, fact-based arguments about historical phenomena. Though historical knowledge is always shaped by the political and social context in which it is created, it still strives for something like objectivity. Historical memory, as I have been writing of it\u2014that is, as an illustration of the historical past that we view and experience as memories\u2014is naturally subjective. We look to historical knowledge to find out <i>what happened</i>, <i>how</i>, and <i>why</i>; we look to historical memory to discover something more ephemeral, <i>what it was like</i>. If we are to gain anything from either the knowledge or memory of history, we should not confound them, or make one serve the fancies of the other. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSecond, historical memory is not a field for egoism. We should not broach it with a lust for personal adventure, as Patton did, or use it to justify elements of our identities, as Lost Causers do. It should have no trace of self-regard. As a child, I practiced historical memory in precisely the wrong way. I wanted to bring the unfamiliar past within the realm of my own experience, to take the gigantic fabric of other people\u2019s lives and cut it down into a coat that I could put on when I felt like it. I wanted history to entertain me and to accommodate me. I wanted to make it familiar for my own enjoyment.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut the past is unrelentingly unfamiliar. Other people\u2019s lives are unfamiliar. We may know tolerably well the <i>what</i>, <i>how</i>, and <i>why</i> of another life, but we never know <i>what it is like</i> to be anyone but ourselves. And if it is impossible to exceed the limits of our own experience, it is often difficult even to remember that something exists beyond those limits. \u201cWe are all of us born in moral stupidity,\u201d wrote the novelist George Eliot, \u201ctaking the world as an udder to feed our supreme selves.\u201d To emerge from this stupidity, to become oriented toward and interested in the world as something other than nourishment for ourselves, is a central task of maturity. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe exercise of historical memory is one route by which we can hope to emerge. Historical memory consists in the effort to see a past that is alien to us as clearly, truly, and immediately as we see our own experience. This is the quality of memory beyond knowledge. To appropriate Eliot\u2019s words again, memory conceives of the historical past \u201cwith that distinctness which is no longer reflection but feeling\u2014an idea wrought back to the directness of sense, like the solidity of objects.\u201d With this distinctness and directness we gain a view of what we could not, perhaps would not, hope to know in the course of our own lives. I hope I never attend an act of vigilante justice like the one Harry Terrel describes, but I can begin to imagine the heady mix of desperation and self-righteousness that impels such an act; how the organizing sanity of civilization might appear to recede, until it seems not only possible but necessary to string a judge up at the fairground. \r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>4</h3>\r\n<h3>From the lofty banks of the Chesapeake Bay</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe best example I have seen of how historical memory can illuminate comes from a lecture by David Blight, an American historian. As a graduate student writing about Frederick Douglass, Blight once spent a day in the company of a Douglass biographer named Dick Preston, touring the places Douglass had lived in Maryland as a young slave. Blight, who is a wonderful story-teller, recounted the trip in a 2008 lecture:<sup><a name=\"id3\" href=\"#ft3\">3</a></sup> \r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n[Dick Preston] lived on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, that much I knew, which is where Douglass grew up [...] Called him, he said, \u2018Yeah, come on out to the Eastern Shore, meet me in the Easton Community College parking lot at 9 a.m.,\u2019 on whatever Wednesday morning it was in July. \u2018I'll give you a tour of the sites of Douglass's youth.\u2019 \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was one of the most extraordinary days of my life. I folded myself into his station wagon and we drove back roads all over the Eastern Shore. He took me for a walk through a muddy cornfield, as I believe it, out to the back lot of a field, to a bend in Tuckahoe Creek, and he said, \u2018This is where Douglass was born. Here\u2019s where [his] Grandmother Betsy's cabin was.\u2019\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThen he took me down all kinds of back roads [...] And then he said, \u2018Do you want to see Covey's Farm?\u2019 Edward Covey, the so-called slave-breaker Douglass had been hired out to, or sent to, by his master Thomas Auld, when he was a 17-year-old, quite rebellious and rather uncontrollable teenager. I said, \u2018Sure, show me Covey's farm.\u2019 Then back roads again that I couldn't find today if my life depended on it. We get out of a car and, in my memory, we stepped over a fencepost, we walked out this ridge, and Dick said something like \u2018turn around.\u2019\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd there they were. He hadn't made it up. \r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nWhat Blight saw when he turned around, and what Douglass hadn\u2019t made up, was the view from Covey\u2019s farm of the Chesapeake Bay, and of the ships that sail it. Looking down at the vessels, Blight remembered how Douglass had seen this sight one hundred and fifty years before. \u201cOur house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake Bay, whose broad bosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable globe,\u201d wrote Douglass in his 1845 autobiography.\r\n<blockquote>\t\r\n<p>\r\nThose beautiful vessels, robed in purest white, so delightful to the eye of freemen, were to me so many shrouded ghosts, to terrify and torment me with thoughts of my wretched condition. I have often, in the deep stillness of a summer\u2019s Sabbath, stood all alone upon the lofty banks of that noble bay, and traced, with saddened heart and tearful eye, the countless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean. The sight of them always affected me powerfully. My thoughts would compel utterance; and there, with no audience but the Almighty, I would pour out my soul\u2019s complaint, in my rude way, with an apostrophe to the moving multitude of ships:\u2014\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u2018You are loosed from your moorings, and are free; I am fast in my chains, and am a slave! You move merrily before the gentle gale, and I sadly before the bloody whip! You are freedom\u2019s swift-winged angels, that fly round the globe; I am confined in bands of iron! O that I were free! Oh, that I were on one of your gallant decks, and under your protecting wing! Alas! betwixt me and you, the turbid waters roll.\u2019\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nBlight calls this passage \u201cthe most beautiful metaphor in anti-slavery literature.\u201d But, he adds, \u201csometimes a metaphor is not just a metaphor.\u201d Of course I don\u2019t know what thoughts passed through Blight\u2019s mind as he stood on that hill. But listening to his story, I felt as though he were inviting me to conceive, with the directness of sense, what is so compelling yet so utterly inaccessible in Douglass\u2019s narrative: the condition of an unfree man. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI absolutely cannot imagine what it is like to be a slave. If anyone other than a slave can imagine such a thing, I am not that person. But I know what it is like to be fixed on the shore, envious of a thing in motion at sea. For Douglass, the beautiful vessels that sailed the Chesapeake were the physical incarnation of freedom. He was as near and as far from those vessels on the ridge at Covey\u2019s farm as he was from the life of a free man. Conceive of that tantalizing separation; the feeling of longing, the sense of affront, the disbelief and anguish, the rage that must have arisen in Douglass\u2019s breast. I can\u2019t conceive it, quite; but standing in my mind\u2019s eye on that lofty bank of that noble bay, with the ghost of Douglass speaking in my ear, I can almost imagine. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\">\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nFor a detailed account of the Continental Army\u2019s quest for supplies in the first year of the war, read David C.

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nDespite the ban on alcohol sales in honor of the upcoming presidential elections, I was presented with a caustically intoxicating Pisco Sour as I sat at the table. I held it up, questioning the propriety of egg whites in cocktails and the incredible ease with which I had circumvented the stay on booze. The waiter could see my gringo sensibilities being challenged and in choppy but passable English gave me a few words of advice. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he laughed, \u201ceveryone cheats.\u201d Clearly I had a lot to learn about Peruvian culture.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the summer of 2006, I left behind the relative safety of a half-gentrified neighborhood in Washington, DC to live in Lima, Peru. I should probably have done more prep work before getting on a plane, but the uncertainty excited me. I stuffed a few shirts in a bag. I found a temporary apartment through Craigslist. Once I scribbled its address onto a folded up piece of scrap paper, I put it in my pocket and headed for the airport.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArmed with a shrink-wrapped Lonely Planet travel book, I arrived in South America without the slightest knowledge of Peruvian current events. As it turned out, my first weekend in Lima was the lead-up to a hotly contested run-off election featuring politicians I never heard of and campaign promises that would never affect me personally. In fact, the weekend-long ban on selling alcohol was the only direct impact I felt from the political drama. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe government\u2019s belief that a sober country would make a more responsible electoral decision caught me somewhat off guard. I had imagined South America as a lawless jungle, replete with non-stop partying and umbrella-capped drinks. In my head, every day was Carnival and women danced in the streets in colorful outfits, twirling flags and flinging beads towards an ever-cheering crowd of tanned revelers. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn lieu of twirling flags, I was distraught to find a buttoned-down conservatism; in lieu of flung beads, rosaries. And what of the bare-breasted goddesses who would call to me with rolled R\u2019s and outlandish hand gestures? They wore dowdy housecoats and whispered about political intrigue. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe only person I knew in the country was a plucky firecracker from Southern California named Kate who introduced herself to strangers for fun. She seemed confident that despite the elections we could still find some enjoyable nightlife, so I put on a fake smile and accompanied her to a jazz club downtown. I readied myself for a quiet evening spent staring soberly at strangers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe ignored everyone\u2019s advice to stay away from unlicensed taxis and hopped in the first unmarked late-model Hyundai we could flag down. <i>At least the cabs are cheap</i>, I told myself between drags on a loosely packed Lucky Strike. <i>And they don\u2019t care if you smoke in the car</i>. I had more faith in Kate\u2019s Spanish than in my own and appointed her my de facto representative to the outside world. I had honestly believed that I would easily dust off the thousands of verbs and conjugations I locked away without use since the end of high school. It was, in hindsight, misguided.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs we drove on in silence, I noticed that Lima felt no less safe to me than the streets of Northwest DC. My parents\u2019 <i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i> reaction when told that I was moving to Lima for the summer seemed somewhat hyperbolic. The Shining Path, a Maoist rebel group that terrorized the country throughout the 1980s and \u201890s, was all but wiped out. Still, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that if my mother knew I was in an untraceable gypsy cab racing breathlessly through Miraflores, Lima\u2019s richest business district, she would have coded on the spot. She might recall hearing about the Tarata Street bombing fourteen summers earlier, and imagine eighteen hundred pounds of dynamite erupting in a deafening blast, killing dozens and wounding hundreds. In her mind, she would see devastation: buildings without faces, distorted girders bending limply askew, char where there were once desks.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut all I saw were Italian restaurants and supermarkets, and I knew nothing of Tarata Street. By the time I got to Peru, the Shining Path focused less on domestic terrorism and more on smuggling coke through the verdant Selva to the east. The country still bore the scars of the decades-long struggle against these revolutionaries, but the political environment had become far less turbulent than in years past.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter some confusion about our ultimate destination, we managed to arrive at the music club Jazz Zone, pronounced <i>yazzone</i> by the locals. Sheets of sound bled out of the windows and into the streets. Forced to duck through the tiny entranceway, I lifted my head as I entered to find a vibrant party scene: lively conversation, English and Spanish melting together amid the milieu of flutes and drums. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWaiters spun around corners, laying down drinks by the tray-full as they sliced through the crowded dance floor. \r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf this was Lima\u2019s version of prohibition, I was behind it one hundred percent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith an impish <i>Hi!</i> Kate struck up a conversation with some strangers nearby and we were soon invited to join them for a drink. The waiter never asked what we wanted. He just planted two Pisco Sours before us as if there were no other drink on the menu. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Everyone cheats</i>, he told me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFinding myself among some well-informed English speakers, I opened the floor to discussion about the elections. Their general sentiment towards the political climate was negative, to say the least. The remaining candidates in the upcoming run-off election were two of the very men who kept the country in chaos throughout the 1980s and \u201890s. On the one hand, voters could chose Alan Garc\u00eda, who as president in the late eighties presided over the country\u2019s economic meltdown and the unchecked rise of the Shining Path insurgency. On the other, the populist candidate Ollanta Humala, famous for leading a military coup against the government in October 2000 and rumored to have committed a number of atrocities during his military campaign against the Shining Path in the 1990s. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPeruvian voters were not exactly spoiled for choice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI learned that Garc\u00eda\u2019s political career started with great promise. After his election to the Presidency in 1985, some hailed him as Peru\u2019s JFK, an image he would quickly destroy. Under his leadership, Peru defaulted on its debt payments and inflation rose to a gut-wrenching 7,500%. The government could barely feed its people. Its ineffectiveness inspired the Shining Path movement. After he lost the next presidential election, Garc\u00eda fled the country amidst mounting accusations that he embezzled millions from his own government. Once the statute of limitations on any corruption charges against him expired a decade later, Garc\u00eda reappeared to run in the 2001 elections. He narrowly lost in the run-off.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHumala lacked Garc\u00eda\u2019s past political experience, but he made up for it with fiery rhetoric that mobilized the nation\u2019s poor. His populist platform, \u201cAgua Por Todos\u201d (\u201cWater For All\u201d), was emblazoned in red paint across the country\u2019s poured concrete half-walls. He buried rumors of human rights abuses committed during his military campaigns against the Shining Path and aligned himself with Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn short, I was able to gather that both candidates managed to piss off a lot of people. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFive feet from the marimba-heavy jazz hooks and the clatter of two dozen twirling feet on the hardwood, I strained to hear the locals lament the political landscape with stoic resignation. While many of the patrons hated Alan Garc\u00eda for his past failures as a president, they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to vote for Humala. They called him a monster between cigarettes; they cursed him between shots of grain whiskey. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe more I listened, the more I realized Garc\u00eda was getting the majority\u2019s vote, albeit grudgingly cast. Many of the Lima elite muttered angrily about the absence of Lourdes Flores from the run-off election. The right-of-center, business-friendly congresswoman brought the promise of economic reform to the upper classes but failed to inspire the populist vote; she lost the second run-off spot to Garc\u00eda by a question-raising half a percentage point. Unable to bring itself to vote for Humala, Flores\u2019 base threw its cautious support to Garc\u00eda.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was enough to secure his victory.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStreets were closed for Garc\u00eda\u2019s inauguration a month and a half later, and members of his left-leaning party, APRA, set out a moderate level of pomp and circumstance to mark the occasion. Riding his borrowed votes to victory, Garc\u00eda called his campaign a victory for the country of Peru and a rejection of Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s influence. Garc\u00eda\u2019s constituency applauded with reluctant fanfare, then returned to their normal routines.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/4/tom-eric.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Tom Tian</i></center></p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe nervous fervor of the days leading up to the election faded, along with the thousands of posters still plastered onto every available inch of wall space. As I traveled throughout the country in the weeks following Garc\u00eda\u2019s victory, I noticed the candidate\u2019s names and faces slowly peeling off the nation\u2019s edifices. Rain made soggy ribbons of the placards but etched ineffectively into the spray-painted campaign promises of the losers. Makeshift campaign centers boarded up their entrances and once again became empty storefronts, their papered windows hiding the piles of undistributed pamphlets and buttons within.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so the summer passed with politics never again as fiercely discussed as it had been during election weekend at Jazz Zone. When my time in Peru ran out, I locked up the memory of the election next to the pluperfect tense and placed them gently into storage for another day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nKate and I still talk fairly regularly, but she continues to introduce herself to strangers for fun in Northwest DC while I hide in the bourgeois anonymity of New York City\u2019s West Village. My time in Lima is far enough gone that I don\u2019t think about Jazz Zone when I crowd into the Village Vanguard. I don\u2019t fantasize about ordering a Pisco Sour while leaning on the shabby couches at Fat Cat on Latin Jazz night. But now, five years removed, Peru faces another electoral cycle. Kate pops back into my life with a simple email, forwarding on the news that another run-off is in the works. Once again, Humala is one of the two remaining candidates. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHumala\u2019s severe populism has reportedly softened since he lost in 2006, but his past affiliation with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez still raises serious concerns about Peru\u2019s social and economic future. Although popular with the nation\u2019s poor, Humala makes the middle and upper classes nervous with his radical plans for market reform. He made a last-minute promise not to nationalize the country\u2019s thirty billion dollar pension fund but still aims to rewrite the nation\u2019s constitution to increase presidential power. News outlets slam him for his unpredictable double talk, and it seems near impossible to parse out which promises Humala means to keep and which he is just making to pull in the votes of the undecided.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRunning against Humala is Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori. Many Peruvians fear that Fujimori would follow in the footsteps of her father, former president Alberto Fujimori, famous for his corrupt, authoritarian regime in the 1990s. Some even assume that Alberto would run the country from his jail cell through his daughter. While Peru\u2019s free market economy might remain safer under Keiko\u2019s rule, the fear of a return to cronyism and corruption keeps potential voters at bay.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust like in 2006, the people must make an unenviable selection between two regrettable candidates. Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa reportedly described picking between Humala and Keiko Fujimori as a choice between cancer and AIDS. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSitting in my cramped Bleecker Street sublet, the words <i>everyone cheats</i> echo in my head. Perhaps Peruvians needed to cheat their way around the alcohol ban, to flout the rules and celebrate the evening as a way to combat the dire atmosphere surrounding the election. Rules are meant to be broken, but the ongoing cycle of disappointing presidential candidates doesn\u2019t seem to be breaking any time soon. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI wish that I could hop into a cheap, unmarked taxi and wallflower at a downtown Lima hot spot. I want to park myself five feet from the marimba-heavy jazz hooks and the clatter of two dozen twirling feet on the hardwood and strain to hear an explanation of why Peru must once again choose the lesser of two evils. But my time in Peru ended years ago, and for this election cycle my knowledge comes from third-hand reports discovered by Google searches. Despite the distance, I can only assume that a sense of stoic resignation once again permeates the hearts and minds of the strangers I once shared \u201cbanned\u201d drinks with at the Jazz Zone, half a decade past. \r\n<img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n",

            "rendered_content": "<blockquote>\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t memory inseparable from the love which wants to preserve what nevertheless passes away?\u201d \u2013 Theodor Adorno, <i>Minima Moralia</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMusic embeds itself in our memory: who has not found themselves humming a tune, often without even being consciously aware of the identity of the tune in question? (By contrast, if one were to say that a painting has been stuck in one\u2019s head all day, or involuntarily mutter the words of a paragraph under one\u2019s breath, one could expect, at best, a curious reception.) It is precisely in its material ephemerality, in its temporality, that music most urgently calls on our memory to preserve it. No sooner is a melody played, or a chord sounded, than it begins to fade away; and for such a gesture to have meaning beyond the immediate moment in which it is sounded, the listener must, on some level, hold it in place in his or her memory. The medium of music is time as much as it is sound; and it is through memory that the listener interacts with that medium.\r\nThough music and memory have long been closely linked, the particular way in which musical memory operates is in no way fixed and immutable. In the transition from Romanticism into modernity, composers\u2019 attitudes towards listeners\u2019 musical memory changed dramatically, shifting from one largely preoccupied with the concept of return, articulated through various formal conventions, to one which treated musical memory both more problematically and more flexibly. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn music of the common practice period (roughly from 1600 to 1900), the concept of return was central to listeners\u2019 experiences of musical memory. This is typified in the concept of sonata form, in which a pair of themes is introduced (exposition), elaborated on (development), and then restated (recapitulation). The first movement of Haydn\u2019s \u201cBear\u201d symphony exemplifies this form: the exposition, which is repeated (a typical practice of the time), occupies 0:00-4:34; the development occupies 4:35-6:10; and the recapitulation occupies 6:11-8:13. \r\n</p>\r\n\t<p> \r\n\t<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/G_cDHaXqLZU\" \t\tframeborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\t</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSonata form, particularly as it was first conceived in the classical era by composers such as Haydn, was highly determined by tonality: the exposition would typically move from the home key for the first theme to a closely related key for the second theme; then travel through increasingly remote keys during the development; and finally return to the home key for both first and second theme in the recapitulation. In the recapitulation, the return of the second theme in particular (e.g., 7:08 in the \u201cBear\u201d symphony) unites two aspects of musical memory that were tremendously important in common practice period music: memory of the theme and the memory of the over-arching key.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is worth noting that throughout the common practice period there was considerable formal variability within sonata form. At times, composers would alter the two-theme structure in the exposition, variously by letting a single basic theme serve as both primary and secondary theme; by having no secondary theme at all; or by creating a false, early entrance of the secondary theme. Similarly, the recapitulation was often the site of formal deformations: here composers often employed techniques such as false recapitulations, in which an apparent return occurs prematurely. Indeed, many scholars prefer to use the plural \u201csonata forms\u201d to suggest this variability. Nevertheless, sonata form(s), both as practiced by composers and as codified by their contemporary music theorists, did provide a general framework for listeners\u2019 musical memory and expectation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy the twentieth century, however, two developments had begun to make the established relationship between music and memory, embodied in the aesthetic of return, problematic. The first of these developments was the gradual expansion\u2014and then decay\u2014of tonality. As sonata form became increasingly focused on the harmonically adventurous development section (and the social ideals of subjective creative fantasy associated therewith), composers developed techniques of harmonic ambiguity to greater and greater extents. Yet these techniques ended up being their own undoing: as composers like Wagner and Liszt began to rely increasingly on the virtually unlimited possibilities tonal ambiguity offered to move to and from distantly related key areas, the very foundation of tonality\u2014the idea of a home key to which the music had some internal obligation to return\u2014became less and less assured; and because the structure of sonata form (as well as that of other common practice period forms) was so strongly based upon tonality, the loss of tonal certainty also meant the loss of relative formal certainty. Without the musical language which gave the return its sense of necessity, such returns increasingly began to appear contrived and imposed arbitrarily from outside.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe second development was technological: the invention and development of audio recording. Whereas music previously could only be mass-reproduced in the form of the soundless score, recordings made it possible for the first time to reproduce performances themselves; and whereas in the epoch before recording technology hearing a symphony was often a once-in-a-lifetime event, recording technology (and the concomitant recording industry) now permits people to hear the same symphony, often in numerous different performances, repeatedly. In this process much of memory\u2019s subjectivity was externalized and became objectivity: musical moments were transferred from within the subject\u2019s memory onto the groove of a wax cylinder or LP record, and so moments of return became less moments of subjective reconstruction within the listener\u2019s mind than moments of objective recognition that could be externally verified. Composers have since responded to this by treating memory in ways that makes this moment of objective recognition problematic. Furthermore, as playback technology became more sophisticated, people became increasingly capable of manipulating their auditory experience of music, cuing forward and backward more as one\u2019s gaze travels around a large painting than as the 19th-century listener would hear a work in the concert hall. The listener can now adopt a position of testing that goes beyond even what Walter Benjamin described in <a href=\r\n\"http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ge/benjamin.htm\"> \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Its Mechanical Reproducibility.\u201d</a> It also creates the possibility for a less linear unfolding of music, as listeners (even when not actively using the options playback technology offers) can apprehend and remember works in a more flexible temporal structure.<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup>   \r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/4/naomi-etha.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Naomi Bardoff</i></center></p>\r\n<p>\r\nWith received ideas about musical memory and return cast so deeply into question, composers of the past century have explored and developed a vast wealth of new possibilities in the ways their music confronts memory, form, and time. Among recent composers, Brian Ferneyhough (1943-), Morton Feldman (1926-1987), and Helmut Lachenmann (1935-) all stand out for the unique ways in which they have explored the problems and possibilities of modern musical memory. The work of all three composers has at best a problematic relationship with concepts of formal return, instead building from within the piece formal structures which the listener must induce from the music itself rather than deduce from received forms. In Ferneyhough\u2019s case, the juxtaposition of linear and non-linear musical thinking becomes a musical element in itself; and moreover, even as his music exploits the potential of recording technology to allow repeated, in-depth listening to his works, he also challenges its objectification of music by always presenting slightly too much, forcing the listener (as well as the performer) to make subjective choices about what and how to remember. If Ferneyhough\u2019s music is concerned with mnemonic too-muchness, then, Feldman\u2019s may be said to be concerned with not-enoughness. In presenting extraordinarily sparse music where repetition is used to disorient rather than orient, his music turns memory introspectively towards itself. Finally, in Lachenmann\u2019s music, the very historically received forms that have become problematic are examined, defamiliarized, and transformed to create a viable new aesthetic. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>1</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFerneyhough, a British composer whose early music education involved playing marching band music but whose own compositional interests lie very far afield from that tradition, belongs to a school often labeled \u201cNew Complexity.\u201d It is perhaps a misleading moniker and incorporates a number of very different composers\u2019 music; nevertheless, the phrase is somewhat suggestive of the tendency Ferneyhough\u2019s work frequently shows towards simultaneously occurring, overlapping threads of development, and with that a flow of musical input that seems to both exceed and stimulate the listener\u2019s ability to remember, process, and \u201ckeep up\u201d with the music. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nResponding to a question about the relationship of simplicity and complexity, the composer gave a concise description of the aim of his \u201ccomplex\u201d music:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nSimplicity seems to me to be characterized by its PASSIVE ambiguity of import (which is not intended as any form of value judgment on my part); complex structures, on the other hand, tend towards an ACTIVE projection of multiplicity (in the sense of incorporating alternative and competing trajectories as \tconstituent contradictions making out an essential element of their expressive substance).\r\n\t</blockquote>\r\nIn his use of musical complexity, Ferneyhough weaves together multiple competing threads of musical expectation and memory, and in so doing shifts the listener\u2019s focus away from a single musical object to which the music might be expected to return and onto the question of how these \u201calternative and competing trajectories\u201d establish and change their relations with one another; and on further listenings, the listener\u2019s perception of these relationships is likely to change.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe two movements of Ferneyhough\u2019s Third String Quartet (1987) provide interesting case studies of Ferneyhough\u2019s approach to musical structure and memory. He describes the two movements as \u201cnegatively mirrored\u201d in their opposition between the non-linear structure of the first movement and the linear structure of the second.\r\n</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/hBlbFHl74Xw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/2rZ926hfakg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\t</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the following discussion, I will highlight the recurrence, combination, and transformation of a few aspects of the movements\u2019 musical material; of course, there are many other things which one might remember and recognize. What is salient in a given piece depends on some combination of the composer\u2019s own foregrounding and backgrounding of various elements, the performers\u2019 priorities in realizing the various elements, and the listener\u2019s particular concerns and attitudes. This multi-faceted, constantly shifting interplay of priorities is in fact one of the reasons Ferneyhough favors the complex style he does: rather than fixing memory in received forms or allowing it to be packaged into single, standardized, reproducible packages, his work demands a dialectic between the \u201ctoo-muchness\u201d of the objective material presented on the one hand, and the subjective memories of the performers and listeners on the other.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nThe first movement is comprised of a series of perceptibly separated phrases in which various types of gestures, sounds, and techniques are combined in constantly changing ways\u2014a bit like the process of looking through a kaleidoscope. Describing the process of writing this composition, Ferneyhough identifies the movement as being \u201ccomposed of some 23 \u2018types\u2019 of activity\u201d; while the listener may not be able to consciously identify all 23, it is my experience that the recurrence of various gestures lends the otherwise fragmentary piece a sense of very audible unity. The movement opens with a striking gesture (0:05-0:08) that pervades the rest of the movement in at least two respects: as a glissando (sliding up or down the string, e.g. at 1:13-1:15 or 1:49-1:53) and as a crescendo (e.g. at 0:25-0:30, 0:49-1:03, and 5:10-5:12); the crescendo in particular often acts as a sort of impetus to begin a new phrase. Another notable recurring gesture is a fragmentary melody first heard at 1:05-1:10. It reappears in other guises at 2:33-2:37 (plucked) and 4:06-4:22 (in the violin\u2019s high register); most striking, though, is its appearance at 8:39-8:48, where the violinist plays it very quietly, with a somewhat hesitant rhythm, and with a faint, breathy timbre\u2014as if evoking a distantly recalled memory. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn a larger scale, as the movement progresses, Ferneyhough\u2019s combinatorial strategies change, generating an overall structure that can be roughly divided into two parts. In the first part of the quartet, the various elements are combined in elaborately overlapping ways; seldom do two instruments begin to play at the same precise moment. This often produces seemingly unitary sonic objects that actually arise out of the interactions of two or more instruments. On a melodic level, the  brief arpeggio-like figure at 1:22-1:24,  created through the interaction of three separate instrumental lines, exemplifies this; on a harmonic level, the recurring slowly built chords (e.g., 0:11-0:24) fulfill a similar function  To my ear, this  technique reaches its formal and expressive apotheosis in the music at 3:57-4:35, in which Ferneyhough combines seamlessly many of the apparently contradictory elements heard elsewhere in the piece. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut in the music that follows, this combinatorial perfection begins to crack, and the musical surface has changed inexorably by the phrase beginning at 5:59. The music becomes more united (particularly rhythmically) and, perhaps counterintuitively, this greater \u201ctogetherness\u201d of the instruments is actually quite unsettling; the seamless flow of the first section is gone and replaced by brutal unisons (e.g., in the passages at 6:42-6:47 or 7:05-7:17). Though present in the earlier section, such unisons now nearly obliterate all other possibilities; likewise, while polyphonic moments such as the staggered sustained chords do still occur, they are less frequent and are put in a problematic light by the totalizing effect of the unisons. In many respects, the second section, the one in unison, seems to undo, or at least make problematic, the work done in the first. This structural aesthetic\u2014an ending which makes the preceding material more, not less, problematic\u2014is a fairly common one for Ferneyhough,<sup><a name=\"id2\" href=\"#ft2\">2</a></sup> and is in fact at work in the second movement of the quartet as well.\r\n</p>\r\n\t\r\n<p>\r\nIn contrast to the combinatorially structured first movement, the second movement of this quartet unfolds more or less linearly; but even as it does so, it refuses to simply affirm the conventional expectations such structural procedures create. While its structure bears some similarities to sonata form in that it presents unitary material which is developed and, in some sense, returns at the movement\u2019s end, Ferneyhough realizes this structure in a way that makes its suppositions problematic. The movement\u2019s linear impetus is immediately evident from the opening material (0:00-1:14). An extended violin solo that  seamlessly turns into a violin duo, this unitary material is almost disturbing in its forward-moving self-assurance (particularly in its contrast with what we just heard in the first movement). In the subsequent \u201cdevelopment\u201d of this material, Ferneyhough plays on many of the same issues present in the first movement, particularly the issue of polyphony (e.g. at 1:14-2:03) vs. unison (e.g. at 3:42-3:48). Following this quasi-development, the second movement ends, like the first, not with affirmation but with uncertainty: starting at 5:37 the viola plays a solo that is replete with pauses which interrupt and fragment the same material that had been played so self-assuredly by the violin. In some respects this ending can be interpreted as a return\u2014we come back to the opening\u2019s solo instrumentation (albeit in a lower-register instrument) and hear material recognizably similar to that with which the piece began\u2014but the fragmentation makes this return problematic. (Contrast this with a common technique employed in the common practice period, in which material is fragmented over the course of its development, but then affirmatively returns in its unitary form at the movement\u2019s end.)  Thus, while retaining an essentially linear narrative structure, Ferneyhough refuses to affirm memory as a fixed thing: on the return to the object, it is not intact (as it would be in common practice sonata form, or as it is on a recording), but rather fragmented and uncertain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn both of these movements, we see a persistent concern\u2014expressed through two  opposing formal techniques\u2014with pushing the boundaries of listeners\u2019 memory and, in so doing, creating music whose expressive power derives from this challenge. In the first movement, various types of musical material are non-linearly combined and recombined in ever-changing configurations, revealing conflicts between the materials as much as concords; in the second, a single piece of musical material is developed, ultimately fragmenting into a problematic return.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>2</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nIf you play Morton Feldman\u2019s <i>Triadic Memories</i> immediately after having heard the Ferneyhough, you\u2019re likely to find the contrast between the two composers\u2019 works quite jarring. \r\n</p>\r\n\t<p> \r\n\t<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/JfKJ8SrmsTA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\t</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn contrast to Ferneyhough\u2019s manipulation of dense layers of musical activity, in Feldman\u2019s music it is the very sparseness of musical material that causes the listener to lose his or her mnemonic bearings. While Ferneyhough explores how the simultaneous presence of multiple possible interpretations of musical material problematizes the listener\u2019s experience of musical memory, Feldman explores how the absence of a clear interpretation does the same.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe hour-long work was written at a time late in Feldman\u2019s life when the composer was experimenting with pieces of extended duration, the most extreme example of which is surely his 1983 String Quartet II, lasting over six hours in one performance. As its title suggests, <i>Triadic Memories</i> is a piece in which Feldman\u2019s preoccupation with the problems of memory come to the fore. Feldman explained the piece\u2014and one section, from 46:25-53:45 in particular\u2014thus: \r\n\t<blockquote>\r\n\tWhat Western musical forms have become is a paraphrase of memory. But memory could operate otherwise as well. In <i>Triadic Memories</i>, a new piano work of mine, there is a section of different types of chords where each chord is slowly repeated. One chord might be repeated three times, another, seven or eight\u2014depending on how long I felt it should go on. Quite soon into a new chord I would forget the reiterated chord before it. I then reconstructed the entire section: rearranging its earlier progression and changing the number of times a particular chord was repeated. This way of working was a conscious attempt at \u2018formalizing\u2019 a disorientation of memory. Chords are heard repeated without any discernible pattern. In this regularity (though there are slight gradations of tempo) there is a suggestion that what we hear is functional and directional, but we soon realize that this is an illusion; a bit like walking the streets of Berlin, where all the buildings look alike, even if they\u2019re not.  \r\n\t</blockquote>\r\nDespite the composer\u2019s own somewhat nebulously subjective description of his criterion for how often to repeat a chord (\u201cdepending on how long I felt it should go on,\u201d) one can detect a definite strategy at play in trying to effect the listener\u2019s mnemonic disorientation\u2014namely, an oscillation between \u201cregular\u201d even-number repetition amounts and \u201cirregular\u201d odd-number repetition amounts, with the odd-numbered repetitions destabilizing the neatly-divided symmetry of the even ones. In addition, a gradual general decrease in average number of repetitions\u2014without ever actually coming to anything resembling a formal \u201carrival\u201d\u2014helps to achieve the illusory sense of functionality and directionality Feldman seeks.\t\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis interest in irregular repetition, change, and the disorientation of memory is evident throughout the piece. For instance, in the opening section (up to 2:56), the same sequence of pitch classes, in a subtly shifting rhythmic configuration, is heard repeatedly.  As this opening section progresses, Feldman alters the register in which the pitch sequence is played: it begins, quite strikingly, with half the material in the piano\u2019s lowest register and the other half in the piano\u2019s highest; then gradually draws into the piano\u2019s middle register, culminating when the two parts overlap at 1:36; and finally moves away back into the more extreme registers, this time with the high and low parts reversed. These registral changes have the effect of a sonic focusing in and out on the material, as the pitch content becomes much more clear and identifiable when the music moves away from the extreme high/low registers and into the middle register. In addition, the quantity of time, and number of repetitions, spent in a given register varies so as to make the registral shifts impossible to predict. In its joining of simplicity with unpredictability, and of stasis with change,  the material provokes the listener\u2019s faculties of memory and pattern recognition even as it disorients and exposes the inadequacies of those faculties. \t\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn <i>Triadic Memories</i> and Feldman\u2019s later work more generally, memory, rather than mediating musical experience, is the object of musical experience; the listener experiences a reversal of the traditional relationship of musical memory and musical material. Rather than memory being placed in the service of material (either for the sake of recognizing a moment of return, or even for the sake of recognizing changing and competing relationships), material is placed in the service of memory\u2014to make the listener more aware of the processes, often unconscious, through which memory works. In doing this Feldman\u2019s music also resists the objectification of memory, but in a quite distinct way from the way that Ferneyhough resists it: in creating music that uses memory as an agent of illusion (\u201c\u2026all the buildings look alike, even if they\u2019re not\u2026\u201d), Feldman\u2019s music simultaneously negates memory\u2019s claim to represent and interpret objective phenomena, and makes the listener aware of the subjective means by which memory attempts to do so.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>3</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhile in both Ferneyhough and Feldman\u2019s work, memory acts primarily within the individual pieces, relating various elements of the particular work with one another, Helmut Lachenmann\u2019s work takes as a prominent reference point various external forms, conventions, and even melodies drawn from received musical traditions. At the same time, the purpose of this is not to provide the listener with a comfortable point of recognition, nor to create a diverting musical version of \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo?\u201d for the listener to play. Rather, it serves as a structural foundation and source for various expressive elements which Lachenmann isolates, deconstructs, and recasts in new contexts. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne example of Lachenmann\u2019s approach to musical tradition and memory can be heard in his <i>Tanzsuite mit Deutschlandlied</i> (1979-80), whose title gives an indication of some of the musical-historical concerns with which the piece occupies itself. \r\n</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t<iframe width=\"425\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ebsF16Ywwsk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\t</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<i>The other three parts follow on YouTube.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe \u201ctanzsuite\u201d (German for \u201cdance suite\u201d) was a musical form favored by composers of the Baroque era; it consisted of forms derived from social dances, such as the allemande, sarabande, gigue (jig), and minuet. In the suite context, these forms often ended up quite distant from any kind of danceability (imagine, for instance, attempting to dance a jig to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW9Qw7hkAiU\">this gigue from Bach\u2019s first keyboard partita</a>).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLachenmann\u2019s take on this tradition consists of a dizzying array of dance- and opera-inspired movements in which he isolates, exaggerates, and transforms single aspects of the genres in question. The range of dance types he draws on far exceeds what would be available to the Baroque dance suite composer\u2014in addition to typically Baroque genres such as the gigue, aria, and capriccio, it also includes dance forms such as the waltz, tarantella, and polka, which gained their compositional popularity in the Romantic era\u2014a cross-historical juxtaposition by no means unfamiliar to the modern listener, who might find himself shuffling from a Bach gigue straight to a Chopin waltz on iTunes. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe work, while meant to be played continuously, is divided up as follows (YouTube part and time cues in parentheses):\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section I</span>: Preambule (Part 1 0:00-3:31)<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section I</span>: Intro (Part 1 3:32-3:41)<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section I</span>: Valse (Part 1 3:42-4:00)<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section I</span>: Marche (Part 1 4:01-4:40)<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section I</span>: Transition (Part 1 4:41-5:50)<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section II</span>: Sicilienne (Part 1 5:51-end)<br />    \r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section II</span>: Capriccio (Part 2 0:00-2:26)<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section II</span>: Valse Lente (Part 2 2:27-4:56<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section III</span>: Transition (Part 2 4:57-6:37)<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section III</span>: Gigue (Part 2 6:38-end)<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section III</span>: Tarentelle (Part 3 0:00-0:55)<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section III</span>: Transition (Part 3 0:56-1:37)<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section IV</span>: Aria I (Part 3 1:38-3:16)<br />\r\n<i>At this point in the YouTube video there is a silence from 3:17-7:26 that is not supposed to be there.</i><br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section IV</span>: Polka (Part 3 7:27-end)<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section IV</span>: Aria II (Part 4 0:00-1:24)<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section V</span>: Intro (Part 4 1:25-1:39)<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section V</span>: Galop (Part 4 1:40-4:53)<br />           \r\n<span class=\"dark\">Section V</span>: Coda (Aria III) (Part 4 4:54-end)<br />\r\n</blockquote>\r\nIn his treatment of these genres Lachenmann frequently draws on the contrast between melodic lyricism and \u201cunpitched\u201d rhythmic gestures. (There is not really such a thing as an \u201cunpitched\u201d sound; however, various means can be used to make pitch a less salient category.) A particularly striking example of the pitched/unpitched dialectic is heard in Lachenmann\u2019s take on the sicilienne genre, heard from 5:51 to the end of the first part of the piece\u2019s YouTube video. (An example of the sicilienne genre can be heard in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGiz1AiJstI\">the sinfonia of Bach\u2019s Weihnachtsoratorium</a>, a movement from which Lachenmann drew some of the material used in Tanzsuite; note especially the lilting rhythm typical of the sicilienne). As Lachenmann\u2019s sicilienne  progresses, the characteristic lilting rhythm becomes more and more pronounced.  A climax of sorts is heard from 7:12-7:27, where Lachenmann presents a brief phrase of lyrical, pitched material that  refuses integration into the rhythmic scheme of the section. Shortly after this we hear a percussion solo (beginning at 7:57) which, to my ears, is the most expressive moment in the \u201cmovement.\u201d Similar juxtapositions and productive conflicts between lyricism and rhythm occur in many other parts of the work. In drawing attention to the rhythmic content of the music, particularly in its (often stark) contrast to the pitched content, Lachenmann directs the listener\u2019s attention to many of the common practice forms\u2019 estranged roots in dance\u2014dance being, after all, an art concerned less with pitch and lyrical singing than with rhythm and movement. Furthermore, these moments of the piece are startlingly expressive, particularly in the context of a musical tradition in which expressivity tends to be associated with clearly pitched melody rather than rhythm.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnother aspect of Lachenmann\u2019s approach towards musical history and tradition is evident in his treatment of the <i>Deutschlandlied</i>, or the melody of the German national anthem. Originally composed by Franz Joseph Haydn as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3Zs24NJgfI\">the slow movement to his string quartet Op 76/3</a>, it carries strong associations with cultural nationalism and evokes the difficulty many have felt in reconciling Germany\u2019s tradition of high culture with the legacy of the Second World War. The <i>Deutschlandlied</i>\u2019s presence in this work is largely subcutaneous, only remotely coming to the surface at one moment towards the end of the piece (1:25 in Part 4\u2014and even here it is quite distorted). Lachenmann describes his approach thus: \r\n<blockquote>\r\nI wouldn\u2019t call that \u2018quotation.\u2019 I see a big difference. Quotation is the Marseillaise fragment in Debussy\u2019s <i>Feux d\u2019artifice</i>, for example, or the anthems in Beethoven\u2019s <i>Wellington</i> Symphony. It means evoking the familiar fascination of something that everybody already knows [\u2026] I don\u2019t think you can call it quotation if a more or less well-known melody is hidden somewhere in the musical structure. When I take the German national anthem in <i>Tanzsuite</i>, it\u2019s like a skeleton that now serves to help me articulate a characteristic time grid [\u2026] So the fascination of the object is perhaps not destroyed, but it is suspended. \r\n</blockquote>\r\nIn suspending this fascination Lachenmann refuses to treat this cultural symbol unproblematically, instead building out of it, sometimes as if by force, new and often radically different forms of expression.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, the <i>Tanzsuite</i>\u2019s instrumentation, juxtaposing a string quartet against an orchestra, also draws on and confronts historical tradition. While not completely unprecedented, it is nevertheless a quite unconventional choice that, particularly in the context of Lachenmann\u2019s wider aesthetic, is rife with historical connotations and tensions. The string quartet and the orchestra respectively embody the private sphere of chamber music and the public sphere of symphonic music, the intimacy of the salon and the expansiveness of the concert hall; in combining the two in a single work, Lachenmann places the tensions between these two traditions in sharp relief. Moreover, in largely rejecting the historically and technologically objectified conventional uses of the instruments in favor of exploiting a wider range of their sonic possibilities (a technique that has been dubbed \u201cmusique concr\u00e8te instrumentale\u201d), Lachenmann does not merely negate traditional uses of the instruments, but also creates out of them new expressive possibilities; what may sound at first merely like extremely strange sounds become the building blocks of a new kind of musical expressiveness. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nUltimately, perhaps none of these three composers\u2019 approaches \u201csolves\u201d any of the problems of musical memory that have arisen in the last century, but each confronts and illuminates the problems in a unique way. This happens through the density of juxtaposition and development in Ferneyhough\u2019s music, in which the memory struggles to keep up as what seemed self-evident is altered and often becomes problematic in the larger structural framework of the piece; through the apparent simplicity of Feldman\u2019s work, which brings the listener to a more distinct awareness of the workings and limitations of musical memory; or through the historical engagement of Lachenmann\u2019s, which simultaneously critiques and draws creative energy from a tradition whose very existence has seemed suspect. In listening to the music we not only can take in an interesting sonic landscape; we also are given an opportunity to examine, question, and expand the ways in which we ourselves perceive and interact with the temporal phenomena that are made manifest in music. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\">\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nThis is not entirely unprecedented\u2014there is a strong argument to be made that many common practice period forms relied in part on retrospective reinterpretations of  previously heard material\u2014but, I believe, it is a problem that came much more to the fore with the more sophisticated forms of non-linear listening that became possible with the development of increasingly advanced technology. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft2\" href=\"#id2\">2</a></sup>\r\nAnother instance of such a problematic ending can be heard in Ferneyhough\u2019s piano piece <i>Lemma Icon Epigram</i>, for instance.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nTo be possessed by the Windigo,<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup> an evil and cannibalistic spirit that haunted the northern indigenous tribes of North America, was to receive a sort of death sentence, to be lost in the eyes of your people, and to be taken by an all-consuming evil counter to the benevolent giving spirit of Manitou. The threat of such possession was never too distant for the northern tribes, including the Algonquin-speaking Cree nations of Canada. A possessed person posed a threat to the entire clan, and had to be gotten rid of somehow.  Though it was possible with the right treatment and within the right conditions to cure the afflicted individual, the possessed did not always want to be cured and would often request euthanasia, which was granted as it would only prolong their agony to keep them alive in such a state.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat individuals within a clan had the power to euthanize was problematic for French colonists, who tried to impose a belief in the authority of a single ruling figure on native peoples and nations such as the Cree. These conflicting views of authority presented themselves directly in the case of Jack Fiddler, a shaman, or <i>ogema</i>, and leader of the Sucker clan, a group of Cree living in the boreal forest off of Sandy Lake in northwestern Ontario. Along with his brother Joseph, who assisted Jack&rsquo;s mercy killings, Jack Fiddler was brought to Canadian court in 1907, when authorities heard of the death of Wasakapeequay, a woman in danger of turning Windigo who was euthanized nearly two summers before the trial. This would be Canadian law&rsquo;s first visit to the Cree, and a turning point for the formerly isolated indigenous nation. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUntil this point, the Sandy Lake Cree lived apart from Canadian influence, according to their indigenous belief systems. According to author James Stevens, who visited the Sandy Lake Cree in 1971 and wrote a book with Jack Fiddler&rsquo;s grandson, Chief Thomas Fiddler, it was partly due to the relocation of a fur trading post at Island Lake in 1833 that the clan remained so isolated from the outside world. It wasn&rsquo;t until around 1864 that the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company (HBC) sent someone to re-open the older post, where Jack Fiddler would come to get goods. At the time of the initial relocation, the Cree in this area were under the leadership of Porcupine Standing Sideways, a powerful shaman who protected his people from the Windigo long before his son, Jack Fiddler (He Who Stands in the Southern Sky), would take up this task. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn Porcupine&rsquo;s time, the HBC enlisted the help of many indigenous clans to do their fur trapping in exchange for goods such as weaponry, clothing, and alcohol. This latter good was included in many of the Cree&rsquo;s rituals and healing practices, and was a powerful incentive for the Sucker Clan and others working for the HBC. Over the course of roughly three decades, the Sucker people depleted their game, causing a shortage of both furs and food. Aside from those who ventured out to trading posts, few of the clan members ever came into contact with white settlers, and the Sandy Lake Cree as a whole were left alone to deal with chronic famine, nascent alcoholism, and severely depleted natural resources. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWithin this context Windigo legends flourished among the Sucker clan. In general the Windigo could be viewed as an evil counterpart to Manitou, the all-giving spirit, though this relationship was in no way a strict dichotomy, and the Windigo was but one of many manifestations of evil or misfortune. Porcupine Standing Sideways notoriously defeated a Windigo sent from a rival clan along the White Pine Narrows\u2014in this case the Windigo was an agent of externally inflicted starvation and his defeat an act of protection for the Sucker clan. As famine led to greater and greater loss of life, tales proliferated wherein the Windigo, manifested as a possessed individual or an abstract threat, was defeated by clan members. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Red Tail and the Windigo&rdquo; is one such story. The story begins with the imminent threat of the Windigo, felt throughout the camp in the form of a sudden physical and mental depression that was accompanied by portentous meteorological conditions (a darkened sky) and a frightening, audible presence in the distance. Despite the efforts of the clan&rsquo;s medicine men to abate the evil presence, the howling winds and oppressive atmosphere persisted, and the clan knew it would be a short time before they were defeated by the Windigo. Red Tail, an outcast with no wife or children, claimed that he had the power to defeat the spirit but would only succeed with the help of offerings from the medicine men. His clan mocked him for his nerve, and the medicine men continued to fail at their efforts against the Windigo. Eventually they gave in to Red Tail, who defeated the Windigo by smoking a sacred pipe that gave him the power to overcome the monster. The corpse of the beast was found floating face down in the river. Red Tail performed a ritual in a shaking tent, which caused the corpse to disappear. The camp bestowed upon him their most beautiful woman and their utmost respect. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnother tale, told in Steven and Fiddler&rsquo;s book, concerns an individual who worked as a trapper for the HBC. According to the story, the trapper took his wife and children trapping with him during the winter and failed to return before sunset. When he did return, he killed and ate his wife and children. Sensing that something was wrong, an old man at the camp, John Doggy, prepared to deal with the possibility of a Windigo by procuring tarps, chains, and ropes from the HBC trading post. John Doggy and a team of men went to confront the trapper as he returned from another trip. The men successfully trapped the trapper, who began to transform into the monster, growing larger and larger and emitting noise &ldquo;that sounded like pieces of ice grinding together.&rdquo; The men also discovered that a bucket he was carrying contained his children&rsquo;s feet. John Doggy and the other men took the Windigo back to the HBC lodge, where, interestingly enough, it was the white men who revived him with whiskey. When questioned as to the whereabouts of his family, the Windigo replied: &ldquo;They are still living. No. I killed them,&rdquo; at which point he began to cry. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis story does not end with the typical defeat of the Windigo by a wise shaman or another powerful clan member. Rather, the Windigo was taken to a mental hospital where he perished, distraught at the knowledge of what he had done to his family. Here the presence of the white man is directly incorporated into the story. The HBC traders were well aware of the Windigo phenomenon, in fact, and were witness to the measures taken by the Cree to deal with the monster, including the killing of those thought to be Windigos. During Porcupine&rsquo;s time, authorities were alerted to such a case and, rather than take action as they would later on, the Lieutenant-Governor of a nearby district dismissed the events, stating that &ldquo;while he regretted to hear of the murder he hoped there would not be any expense incurred,&rdquo; and took no further action. The postmaster at Island Lake, the closest trading post to Porcupine&rsquo;s clan, decided it was best to ignore the problem of the Windigo in the interests of continuing the fur trade.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhile not typical of the Windigo tales that would be spread in the time of Jack Fiddler, the above narrative is important to his case, as it depicts the relationship between the Cree and the white traders as largely non-confrontational. The first story related here illustrates another important aspect of the Windigo narrative, which is that it takes wisdom and courage, as well as the support of the clan, to defeat such a monster. The shamans, who were able to heal and cure, procure food, and defeat adversarial shamans, often became the leaders of their clan. In the case of Jack Fiddler these abilities came along with the power to defeat the Windigo, which became a primary source of his authority over the Sandy Lake Cree. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is important to understand that, to a certain degree, the Sucker people needed a strong defender like Jack Fiddler because of the increasing influence of the HBC. The Suckers brought the constraints of the White Man&rsquo;s demands into their worldview; increased Windigo attacks were the result of this inclusion, and their beliefs adapted to the hardships that ensued. The incidence of Windigo possession was usually correlated with the abundance or lack of provisions that the land provided. Cases of famine cannibalism were seen as the incipient form of Windigo possession, and someone who consumed human flesh was in direct danger of becoming fully possessed, which entailed a whole host of physical transformations including massive growth, hairiness, and eventual self-consumption beginning with the lips and hands. To be turned Windigo in the warmer months was nearly inconceivable, as to become fully Windigo precluded the presence of a warm, beating heart\u2014it was believed that the Windigo possessed a heart of ice. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"picture\"><center><img src=\"/media/images/2/tom-deborah.jpg\" height=500 class=\"picture\"><br>Illustration by Tom Tian</center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGiven that winter famine was exactly when the Windigo presented itself, it follows that human activity resulting in overfishing or overhunting would affect the frequency of such phenomena. But despite the alarming death rate among the clans, the HBC repeatedly refused to acknowledge that the clans were in any trouble. The Sucker clan went through roughly three generations of endemic starvation and increased cases of Windigo possession before the case of Jack and Joseph Fiddler was brought to court in 1907 and the two men were charged with murder. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe conflicts inherent to this case are self-evident. As First Nations people, the Cree were living under their own law and, more importantly, were entirely oblivious to the law of the White Man regarding murder. To prosecute in the face of such ignorance seems abhorrent to a modern audience, especially given the willingness of both Jack, now in his mid-eighties, and Joseph Fiddler to acquiesce to whatever the soldiers demanded, even offering to completely change their offending practices. Both men requested that the Canadians not &ldquo;be too harsh on them,&rdquo; insisting that they &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t have done it if they had known it was wrong,&rdquo; and that they could return to their clan and teach them what was right. Indeed, most accounts of the case focus on the injustice borne upon the Cree who were robbed of their leaders in the name of the White Man&rsquo;s law without being given forewarning or a just explanation. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnother problem presented by the process of the trial was the portrayal of Jack and Joseph Fiddler, and by extension the Sucker clan, as bloodthirsty, savage murderers, willing to dispose of clan members on a whim and without reason. This opinion, spread primarily via newspaper headlines, made it difficult for the men to receive pardons once convicted, despite several attempts on the part of missionaries and traders who were sympathetic to the Cree and understood that &ldquo;[this] condition is the hell of those Indians.&rdquo; The blind use of Canadian law against the indigenous people in this instance is exemplary of the kinds of trials brought to court without real precedent; more than a simple homicide case, this case represents a conflict between two cohabitant moral structures and, more saliently, different distributions of authority, in particular of the authority to kill. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA more complex reading of this conflict would take into account the fact that underlying the conflict between the Cree and the Canadian ideas of what actions were morally correct were different moral and spiritual understandings of authority and moral accountability. For the Sucker clan, the threat of the Windigo is constant, and defeat of the Windigo a necessity. The threat of the cannibal is not proclaimed by a religious leader, but is understood through common wisdom that is spread throughout the members of any given clan. It is not the <i>authority</i> of a shaman that dictates the killing of an individual, but an obligation to a larger cosmology that he works in deference to. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAs such, it is not necessarily the role of the shaman or chief to execute, or euthanize, an afflicted individual. If there is a threat to the community, it is the responsibility of the community to rid themselves of that threat. In the case of the Sandy Lake Cree, this task fell to Jack Fiddler, whose wisdom and spiritual strength gave him the power to deal with what was generally a traumatic duty. In this regard, killing the Windigo was not an explicit act of authority, but rather the result of a system of power and authority that functioned externally to the clan members, shaman included. The shaman acted as a conduit for the spiritual realm. While he was the one to carry out its requirements, this did not necessarily give him the authority to do something like kill another clan member. Rather, he was called on to perform a duty for the collective. This singular expression of authority was a necessary aspect of an external cosmology that dictated interactions between clan members.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis collective implementation of authority did not fit into the system established by Canadian authorities, largely because their legal structure was based on a moral code rooted in the teachings of Christianity. This manifested itself hierarchically, with individuals like those involved with law enforcement acting simultaneously as moral police. The distance between religious teachings and Canadian law was practically non-existent; during the trial the defendants were asked if they had ever been taught &ldquo;the difference between right and wrong&rdquo; and a native-born missionary was called to the witness stand in order to establish the degree of contact between the Cree and the Christian belief system. Right and wrong under the dictates of Canadian law were conflated with those of Christian teachings in this case, and along with these teachings and subsequent laws came an understanding of authority as both a moral and legal construct. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Cree had no such concept of legality, and morality was intrinsic to the Sucker clan&rsquo;s engagement with its land and constituents. Because of this, authority was disseminated throughout the clan rather than localized in an individual&rsquo;s ability to rule. The wisdom and power attributed to the Shaman and chief were not the same as the authority granted to a Canadian judge or soldier: it was not within the scope of the Shaman or chief&rsquo;s power to <i>punish</i>. In the eyes of the Cree, punishment was an expression of the laws of nature, the inevitable materialization of the laws of cause and effect. When questioned by prosecutor D.W. McKerchar, Angus Rae, a son-in-law of Jack Fiddler, gave the following testimony:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<span class=\"dark\"><span class=\"dark\">McKerchar</span></span>: Did you object to their putting her to death?<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\"><span class=\"dark\">Angus Rae</span></span>: No.<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">McKerchar</span>: Did you say anything?<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Angus Rae</span>: I did not say anything. They were all older than I was and I did not say anything.<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">McKerchar</span>: Would you be punished if you objected to anything that the ogema suggested?<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Angus Rae</span>: I do not know. They might.<br />\r\n\r\n<span class=\"dark\">McKerchar</span>: Is a member of the band bound to obey the ogema, bound to do what the ogema says?<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Angus Rae</span>: Yes. If the ogema tells me to do a thing I must do it.<br /> \r\n<span class=\"dark\">McKerchar</span>: What would happen to you if you did not do what the ogema told you?<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Angus Rae</span>: Something would happen to me.<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">McKerchar</span>: Of what nature, of what kind?<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Angus Rae</span>: I do not know what would happen. Something would happen anyway.<br />\r\n\r\n<span class=\"dark\">McKerchar</span>: Good or bad?<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Angus Rae</span>: Bad.<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">McKerchar</span>: From what source?<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Angus Rae</span>: I do not know what would happen. Something would be wrong.<br /> \r\n<span class=\"dark\">McKerchar</span>: Would it be bad medicine?<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Angus Rae</span>: I will be punished in some way but I do not know how.<br /> \r\n\r\n<span class=\"dark\">McKerchar</span>: By whom?<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Angus Rae</span>: I do not know by whom but I will be punished, however, some way.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nAngus Rae&rsquo;s testimony demonstrates that while Jack Fiddler held power in this situation, any punishment enacted upon a dissenter would be beyond the control of any one individual, including the shaman. This belief relies on the assumption that killing the Windigo was right, and to interfere would be wrong\u2014thus placing Jack Fiddler in a position of authority insofar as he was capable of executing what is right. Furthermore, his actions were supported by the clan, who trusted him based on previous incidents wherein he had proven himself. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOstensibly, Jack Fiddler&rsquo;s power is equivalent to that of the inspector or judge who presides over his case: both are enacting the &ldquo;will&rdquo; of the collective as it is grounded in their respective belief systems. The difference, however, lies in the conceptualization of power and its use. To kill a Windigo is not to punish the individual for what he or she has done. To prosecute a murderer, on the other hand, is to proscribe punishment in proportion to the crime. In a preliminary hearing regarding the case of Jack Fiddler, it was decided that the two men could be punished regardless of their orientation with the law or willingness to change their ways. Rather than come to terms with a system that bestowed authority based on a separate set of criteria from their own, the Canadians who brought the Fiddlers to court attempted to negate the shaman&rsquo;s authority and to ignore the tenets of a belief system that had long co-existed with their own, even if only because of its extreme isolation. Because it was not based in the same teachings or beliefs as their own, the Canadians could not accept the method by which Jack Fiddler came to act on what he deemed &ldquo;right.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLikewise, Jack Fiddler could not accept the authority of the Judge to exercise control over his fate, and he committed suicide one afternoon, more than three months into his imprisonment and after the preliminary hearing that ruled him a murderer. Less than a month later, Joseph Fiddler was brought to trial in the court of Commissioner Aylesworth Bowen Perry, where the jury ruled him guilty of murder but with a recommendation for mercy, &ldquo;on account of the prisoner&rsquo;s ignorance and superstition.&rdquo; The judge replied that &ldquo;The law does not permit me to exhibit any mercy&rdquo; towards Fiddler, who was told that he would under no circumstances receive pardon. In 1909, sick and incarcerated, Joseph Fiddler died. Not three days beforehand, however, he had been officially pardoned after three separate petitions had been sent to the Minister of Justice, the first of which had been issued by Commissioner Perry himself, thirteen days after issuing the conviction. Word of this never reached Joseph before his death. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\"><p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nI use the spelling &ldquo;Windigo,&rdquo; though there are several others\u2014Witikow, Weendigo, etc. George Nelson, a fur trapper who recorded much of his interaction with the Cree in his journals, uses Windigo, &ldquo;according to the French pronunciation, which is more correct than the English, in this word.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nKaraism emerged in the 8th and 9th centuries in Baghdad as a conglomeration of Jewish anti-Rabbinite groups. From the 10th to the 12th century, the Karaite community flourished, economically and culturally, throughout the Muslim world, and above all in Israel. In these years it was both a demographic and an ideological threat to the hegemony of Rabbinism over Judaism, and the literature of both sects reflects this rivalry. But maybe you have been told about the Karaites before. Maybe there are certain things which you already know.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThat is: Karaites hang fringes on their walls. They sit in the cold and dark on the sabbath day. And they wear phylacteries on the bridge of their nose; many have perished through the consequent impairment of their vision. What fools! But above all, the Karaites, having repudiated our traditions, think it sufficient to open up the Bible, as though it were a car manual, and derive their practice through its literal meaning!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBehold and beware those who have rejected the wisdom of tradition, our myths intone&mdash;thereby deflating such a wayward impulse. Behold the wilderness beyond Rabbinical authority! Yet these myths conceal, and even transmit, a provocation to contemporary Judaism. Karaism does to the doctrine police what the other great heresies, Christianity and Reform Judaism, cannot do, because they reject the law outright. Karaism, in contrast, remains closely bound to the law, while still posing a threat to the tradition.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo elucidate Karaism&rsquo;s peculiar and provocative relation to law, it is helpful to distinguish two basic modes of reading an authoritative text. The first entails identification with the circumstances in which the text was written, and requires the assumption that the text as it stands is pertinent to your life. You would read, for instance, a course syllabus in this way. It was written for its term; its instructions anticipate their context and therefore your actions should correspond in a direct way to its specifications. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe second mode of reading is one of distance. The text speaks to and from a context radically distinct from yours. However, it is still your authoritative text; you demand of it that from its distance it address you as well. Though its instructions bind you, you must answer to the exigencies of your own situation. This doubling of address and of reply produces at least two possible sources of conflict between its imperative and your response: between the original idiom and later comprehension, and between ancient instruction and a new context for action. The second mode of reading is an enterprise of ventriloquism designed to mediate these contradictions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nKaraites and Rabbis alike find themselves in this latter situation, bound to a text written for the people of ancient Israel; and so both are engaged in this second mode of reading. Rabbis, for their part, respond to the strangeness of the written Torah by diffusing its authority across subsequent generations: each successive crop of scholars must answer to each of those that came before it. The previous generations had a closer relationship to revealed truth, and serve as intercessors between the present and the original imperative. However, this technique for mitigating the strangeness of scripture also multiplies it: the interpreter now must answer to a bewildering litany of strangenesses, each alien to the rest. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nKaraism rejects this cacophony and boldly begins again. Whereas the Rabbis entangle the law in a proliferation of textual strangeness and exegetical responsibilities, the Karaites cut away this invasive growth and tackle the strangeness of scripture directly and openly. In constructing an unmediated, transparent relationship between scripture and the present, they repair the Rabbinical severance of law from scripture. Karaism can even be defined this way: as life animated directly by a scriptural hermeneutic of law. But what exactly this directness entails is not yet clear. And moreover, it is obvious that unmediated access to scriptural authority entails political and social complications: the authority of individual reason must be tempered by a commitment to a practicable communal law. How, exactly, do these many valences of social and individual interpretation overlap? To present a provocation to contemporary Judaism, it will be necessary to make the figure of Karaism appear more precisely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat is meant by &ldquo;directness&rdquo;? The Karaites are not, as they are sometimes reputed to be, naive enough to believe in the integrity of an uncompromisingly literal reading of scripture. It is true that Karaite exegetes often write in terms of a literal understanding, but what is meant by this designation is more accurately a <i>plain</i> understanding. Rabbinic exegesis has an equivalent category of interpretation, called <i>peshat</i>, which is an attempt to read scripture in a manner unmediated by homiletical or legal interests. In <i>peshat</i>, one is meant to read scripture as a cohesive literary unit, with a consequent emphasis on grammatical and thematic coherence. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBoth the Rabbis and the Karaites are interested in and capable of this kind of reading, but only the Karaites imagine it to be the basic articulation of law. Rabbinite law matured long before the fully developed idea of a <i>peshat</i> hermeneutic. A Rabbinical legal reading of scripture deliberately decontextualizes and degrammaticizes passages and even individual words, manipulating them as raw material for the production of law. They justify this method by the axiom of scripture&rsquo;s fundamental incompleteness&mdash;even incoherence&mdash;without the penumbra of orally transmitted knowledge which surrounds it. According to the Rabbis, a bipartite Torah was imparted to the people at the revelation at Sinai, consisting in the written Torah and the oral Torah, neither of which could stand alone. Karaism rejects this axiom as an insult to the integrity of scripture.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo illustrate the differences between Karaitic and Rabbinic legal reasoning, I will compare their expositions of a single scriptural verse: &ldquo;Do not boil a kid in its mother's milk.&rdquo; The Rabbis elaborate this verse into its legal form by two techniques. The first is an exegetical method, though not at all directed towards the plain meaning of scripture. They begin their exegesis by observing that the verse occurs three times in the Torah. Scripture, according to the Rabbis, contains no redundant words. Thus, outside of the single apparent sense, the Rabbinic system feels compelled to derive added, arcane meanings: each of the three instances must be meant to impart three separate interdictions. It is forbidden not only to cook the kid in its mother&rsquo;s milk, but also to eat the result; it is also forbidden to derive benefit from the result, for example by sale. The Talmud includes several competing arguments, but, tellingly, each arrives at this same triad. The verse is also extended from the particular to the general to apply to any kind of domestic meat and milk, instead of only of a kid and in the milk of its mother particularly. The Rabbis consider all of these prohibitions to be conveyed by the Torah itself. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Rabbis also employ a second mode of legislation, wholly external to scriptural exegesis. By the force of their own authority, they derive two further conditions, without scriptural support, prohibiting the consumption of meat and milk together even when cooked separately, and stipulating a waiting period between the consumption of meat and the consumption of dairy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nKaraism, of course, rejects these last directives, whose authority is exclusively Rabbinic and without support in scriptural exegesis. But much of the Rabbis&rsquo; textual work is rejected as well. According to Elijah Basyatchi, a 15th-century Karaite legalist, there is no reason for three recurrences of an identical verse to engender separate legal rulings: for whatever reason, scripture simply repeats the same law in three different contexts. However, Basyatchi also does not limit the verse to its literal meaning. He applies a principle which extends laws regarding the particular to the general as well, and rules that there is a law against the boiling of the young of any species in the milk of its mother. He then suggests, through other scriptural uses of the word &lsquo;boil,&rsquo; that any kind of cooking is similarly forbidden. Then, through a parallel to the implications of &lsquo;you shall not slaughter,&rsquo; he concludes that one must also not eat such a culinary product. Basyatchi maintains, however, not merely that the prohibition is restricted to animals of the same species, but that it applies only to the meat and milk of an actual parent-child pair. The logic of this prohibition, he argues, is to be found in the ethical root of another scriptural prohibition: &ldquo;You shall not slaughter a mother and its young on the same day.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe point of this exercise was not to demonstrate an obsessive denial of pleasure on the part of the Rabbis, nor a relative laxity in the Karaites. Karaitic law is often more restrictive of human impulses than Rabbinic. What&rsquo;s crucial is the difference in attitudes towards scripture as a source of law. For a Rabbinic legalist, scripture must be in a sense decoded in order to become law. Thus the development of a code of law depends completely on the arbitration of expert knowledge, which can look at a verse (or even a phrase or a word) and assign it to a point of law over and against its apparent meaning. For a Karaite legalist, understanding scripture is understanding law. The scripture itself is already a code of law: expert knowledge may be useful in the processes of analogy and extension, but the actual interpretation and development of law should be rationally accessible.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis emphasis on rational access is an epistemological presupposition of Karaism. However, to what extent this rationalism is compatible with the temporal continuity or social coherence of a religious community, is subject to question. These questions are raised by Avraham ibn Ezra in his polemic against the Karaites. Ibn Ezra was a <i>peshat</i> interpreter of scripture who rejected the search for esoteric mystical meanings within it. He was in regular correspondence with several Karaites and sometimes took their advice on a point of interpretation. This polemic is of additional interest because of ibn Ezra&rsquo;s close proximity to the phenomenon he excoriates.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nIf we find two meanings to a verse, and one accords with the words of the ancients&mdash;who were all righteous people&mdash;we will rely on their truth without doubt. Woe that we should be mixed around with the Sadducees [i.e. the Karaites], who claim that the ancients undermined scripture and its grammatical particularities! To the contrary, those before us were of truth, all of their words were of truth, and the God of truth leads his servant on the path of truth.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThe underlying logic of ibn Ezra&rsquo;s pronouncement is that the authentic mode of access to divine will is through the authority of a tradition of human stewardship. His concluding stanza subtly draws together the ideas of divine truth and human tradition: the image of God leading his servant to truth by way of a <i>path</i> is meant to evoke the path of transmission through history by way of people <i>before us</i> who were righteous, and therefore deserving of God&rsquo;s truth. A rupture with the &ldquo;ancients,&rdquo; especially one that censures their &ldquo;undermining&rdquo; of scripture, actually undermines the surest means of understanding God's will. He supplements this defense with an attack on the Karaite method: \r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThey who reject the religion and its defenders&mdash;they will lean either to the left or to the right. Each will interpret scripture according to his own will, even as to the statutes and the laws. [\u2026] And how will they support the Law according to their knowledge? When every moment it is upended and flipped from one side to another according to their fickle cares? For there will not be found in the Torah any commandment that is fully explained.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nUndue reliance on scripture alone, he claims, results in an unstable reliance on oneself and one&rsquo;s &ldquo;fickle cares&rdquo; rather than on God. Thus the formulation: &ldquo;It is God alone that I fear; I will not show favor to the Torah.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIbn Ezra asserts that Karaite scripturalism implies historical discontinuity&mdash;&ldquo;fickleness&rdquo;&mdash;and social incoherence&mdash;&ldquo;each\u2026 according to his own will.&rdquo; How could a religion in which everyone is free to set their own practice according to their own understanding be a reflection of truth? \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIbn Ezra's charge of Karaism&rsquo;s individualism does accord with the self-characterization of some modern Karaites, but his contemporary Karaites would have seen such a characterization as slander. Karaism insists on the supremacy of reason, but it does not speak the language of radical individualism. Al Kirkisani, a Karaite scholar of the 10th century, instructs reliance on the wisdom of sages, who have a better grasp of reason than laypeople. Basyatchi thinks it preferable to achieve an understanding of the rational underpinnings behind the law, but only after conforming to it by accepting tradition; refusing to do so would be like refusing to eat bread before learning to bake. That is, while Karaites do believe in the importance and possibility of individual interpretation of scripture, they recognize the importance of tradition and social coherence as well.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe law, though accessible to individual rationality, remains a social object. It&rsquo;s true that certain voices within Karaism called for conduct founded purely on scripture, but the Karaite development of law codes was no accident. Such codes were generally in intimate dialogue with tradition, often featuring the kind of imaginative scriptural reasoning we might characterize as far-fetched or Rabbinic. Though the idea of a religious law code, an elaboration on revealed divine truth, might seem inimical to the whole project of Karaism, the perennial appearance of such codes actually illuminates an essential tendency of the project. While Karaism disputes Rabbinism with regard to the proper source of law, its law remains social rather than individual.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nKaraism was provocative even in its caricatured form, but the provocation remained vague. After the above considerations, however, it can perhaps become more useful. The work of anti-Karaite rhetoric has been to construct false frontiers of debate. The idea of a cartoonishly simple and direct scriptural hermeneutic promotes an easily falsifiable sense that Rabbinic interpretation is fundamentally more sophisticated. The charge of individualistic social corrosion fails to address the real depth of Karaite tradition and social ties. Both of these shoddy claims against Karaism only approximate the kind of critique that could be made.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe first step that should be taken in revitalizing this polemic is in understanding that the questions that the polemic is meant to satisfy are ultimately questions about the Rabbinic tradition itself. That is, when you offer sham answers to questions about the Karaites, you also fail to answer real questions about the legitimacy of the Rabbinic tradition. The idea of Karaism should be used to shed light on Rabbinism as its counterpart: this is where the Rabbinic response should begin. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt seems to me that Karaism is most useful in that it offers us the opportunity to disseminate and explain a basic premise of Rabbinic law that should not go unexamined: the dissociation between scripture and code of conduct. Initiates to Judaism are left without an explanation for something that should be presented as a lynchpin of the system. Its justification is that both the projects of interpretation of scripture and the development of law have freedom of movement because of their dissociation. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nInterpretation can be allowed the creative license of literary work without needing to shape itself to the effects it might have on real world practice. Famously enigmatic and profoundly original, midrashic literature is defined by the Rabbinic mining of scripture as the raw material for their own language. Because scripture is seen as a radically distant arcane text, it becomes freer as a poetic word-mine, wherein images and idioms can be decontextualized and redeployed with impunity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, law becomes answerable to real world local concerns instead of to the immovability of scripture. The real power of the idea of the dual law lies in the premise that God's will is embedded in the people as much as in the words of scripture. The idea of law as a human, dialectical system is not a cause for embarrassment. It is in many respects the only reasonable response to divine silence. The most compelling response to Karaism lies in this idea that religious truth can emerge from a non-divine, multivocal source. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nIn his book <i>On Clowns: The Dictator and the Artist</i>, Norman Manea writes of life in Romania during the Communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu. He suggests that the most insidious aspect of the dictatorship was not the persecution and physical violence, but rather the dehumanization of its subjects. Central to this dehumanization was the appropriation of what I call individual interpretive authority, or the authority of the individual to make claims about himself and his situation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCeau\u015fescu succeeded in appropriating the interpretive authority of his people by manipulating the nationalistic tendencies already in place at the time. Relying on their desperation for a sense of national significance as well as their desire for independence from both Soviet domination and Western influence, he drew the country deeper and deeper into his own ideology, in which he and the Romanian government were fearsome, powerful, and infallible. But interpretive authority should belong to the individual, not to the dictator or the Law, and if the individual loses this authority he may lose himself entirely to illogical and ungenerous whims of the dictator:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nBy decree, our clown has changed the whole country into a huge kindergarten populated by militarized and industrious children; but he can&rsquo;t stand his own \u2018children,&rsquo; or \u2018subjects.&rsquo; If they obey, he spits on them and beats them up; if they act up, he cuts off an ear; if they disobey, he sews their lips shut; if they get sick, he presents them with a coffin and a bill for funeral expenses.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\nHere, the dictator has transformed the individual into a child, dependent upon the Law for its approval or disapproval; but the dictator is not sympathetic to the child, and so even obedience will be met only with spite.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn oppressive circumstances resistance is essential, and it seems that the most effective mode of resistance for a writer like Manea would be to directly challenge Ceau\u015fescu&rsquo;s nationalistic ideology. However, Manea reminds us that such public challenges are not always possible or effective, especially in circumstances where censorship prevails and outspoken intellectuals are persecuted. Furthermore, Manea argues, a direct challenge to Ceau\u015fescu&rsquo;s ideology fails to escape the greater interpretive paradigm of the dictatorship. Better to fight back with a reassertion of one&rsquo;s own interpretive authority, to ridicule the dictator with &ldquo;vengeful irony\u201d or perhaps to reject his paradigm by simply ignoring him:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nI refused to serve our tyrannical clown not because I disdained his favors but because I tried to ignore him as best I could. [\u2026] I took good care not to hate him [Ceau\u015fescu], because that would have meant granting him too much importance\u2014even though like a huge, tireless octopus he had already discharged so much shit that we were almost suffocating under it.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nEven hating Ceau\u015fescu, portraying him as cruel and manipulative, is an implicit acceptance of  his paradigm because it acknowledges the weakness of the isolated individual when faced with a powerful government. Instead, Manea seeks to replace Ceau\u015fescu&rsquo;s paradigm of unquestioning Romanian nationalism with his own paradigm, in which Ceau\u015fescu is a bumbling clown, unworthy not only of respect but even of hatred. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI want to turn to Kafka&rsquo;s novel <i>The Trial</i> as a particularly dark image of what might happen if the individual tries to resist oppression without first escaping the interpretive paradigm of his oppressor.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center></p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n<i>The Trial</i> shows the struggle between an individual and the Law for interpretive authority, and the dehumanizing process of losing such a struggle. A man named K. is inexplicably arrested one morning, and he expends a great deal of energy trying to defend himself against a charge that he knows nothing about. Shortly after being arrested he tells the guards, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the law\u2026 it probably exists only in your heads.\u201d They assure him: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel it eventually.\u201d And K. does come to feel the Law: over the course of the novel, he finds himself inadvertently shedding his own interpretive authority as he becomes more and more deeply absorbed in the interpretive paradigm of the Law. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn order to understand what is at stake in the loss of interpretive authority, it is first helpful to examine someone who possesses it. At the beginning of <i>The Trial</i>, K. is such a man. He interprets his situation independently from the Law&rsquo;s paradigm and so recognizes the absurdity of his arrest: \r\n<blockquote>\r\nK. stared at the inspector. Was he to be lectured like a schoolboy by what might well be a younger man? To be reprimanded for his openness? And to learn nothing about why he had been arrested and on whose orders? He grew increasingly agitated, paced up and down, freely and without hindrance, pushed his cuffs back, felt his chest, brushed his hair into place, went past the three men, muttering, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s completely senseless,\u201d at which they turned and looked at him in a friendly but serious way, and finally came to a stop before the inspector&rsquo;s table.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nHere, K. is  confident and possesses a healthy sense of outrage at his situation. His annoyance at being chastised by &ldquo;what might be a well younger man\u201d shows both confidence in himself and a mistrust of bureaucratic authority; it also shows that here he perceives the inspector not as a representative of the Law but as merely another man, more deserving of contempt than respect. K. paces &ldquo;freely and without hindrance,\u201d and he feels his chest and brushes his hair into place, showing ownership over his own actions and body. Now he has sufficient interpretive authority to be his own man; however, K.&rsquo;s increasing engagement with the Law on its own terms causes him to lose this sense of self-ownership and become increasingly dependent upon the constituents of the law. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nConsider the following scene, from much later in the course of K.&rsquo;s trial. He enters an attic in order to investigate the law office that resides there, and although he has expressed confidence dealing with officials in the past, he now feels suddenly unsure of himself and wants to leave. Earlier, in the security of his own home, he thought of the inspector as an uppity &ldquo;younger man\u201d; now, in the dusty attic, he imagines confronting &ldquo;some high official\u201d and this thought makes him sick. A woman tells him that he looks unwell, and he immediately begins to feel dizzy. When a man suggests that the dusty attic air is the source of K.&rsquo;s illness, and that he should be led out of the law offices into fresh air, K. latches desperately onto the man&rsquo;s suggestion:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,\u201d K. cried out, so overjoyed he barely let the man finish his sentence, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll feel better soon, I&rsquo;m not that weak, I just need a little support under the arms, I won&rsquo;t be much trouble, it&rsquo;s not very far, just take me to the door, I&rsquo;ll sit on the steps a bit and be fine soon, I never have attacks like this, it surprised me too. After all, I&rsquo;m an official myself and I&rsquo;m used to the office air, but it does seem really bad here, you say so yourself. Would you be so kind as to help me a little, I&rsquo;m dizzy, and I feel sick when I stand on my own.\u201d And he lifted his shoulders to make it easier for the others to grab him under the arms.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\nK. speaks quickly, nervously, and without authority, and he feels no shame at his complete dependence on the other people in the office. He does not even have the final word on his own physical symptoms: he only starts to feel dizzy when a woman tells him that he looks unwell, and he finds an explanation for his dizziness not through his own reasoning but through the suggestions of others. Worst of all, far from pacing confidently up and down as he did before, he cannot even stand on his own, and, like a small child or an injured puppy, he lifts his shoulders &ldquo;to make it easier for the others to grab him under the arms.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the final consequences of K.&rsquo;s loss of interpretive authority is that the Law  appropriates his identity until neither his name nor his actions are his own. Near the end of the story K. meets a priest\u2014also the prison chaplain\u2014who says without any introduction, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Josef K.\u201d \r\n<blockquote>\r\n&ldquo;Yes,\u201d said K.; he recalled how openly he had always said his name; for some time now it had been a burden, and people he met for the first time already knew his name; how good it felt to introduce oneself first and only then be known.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nOnce he  was &ldquo;Josef K., the successful banker,\u201d but now he is only &ldquo;Josef K., the defendant.\u201d His name has become a burden to him because it is no longer his to define as he pleases. The same is true of K.&rsquo;s actions; they, too, have been usurped. Shortly before he parts ways with the priest, K. asks, &ldquo;Do you want anything else from me?\u201d The priest replies, &ldquo;Why should I want anything from you. The court wants nothing from you. It receives you when you come and dismisses you when you go.\u201d The court wants nothing from K. because it has already taken everything; it has anticipated each of his actions so precisely that it has become impossible to determine whether his actions\u2014his coming and going\u2014are motivated by his own will, or if they are mere extensions of the will of the Law. K. is so profoundly entangled in the Law&rsquo;s paradigm that he cannot interpret himself and his situation on his own terms: now, the Law has the final word on all matters Josef K.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center></p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/2/wesley-hannah.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br>Illustration by Wesley Ryan Clapp</center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHow does Josef K. lose himself to the Law? Unlike Manea, who repeatedly asserts his own interpretive authority by contrasting it explicitly to Ceau\u015fescu&rsquo;s paradigm, K. all too often seeks justice within the Law&rsquo;s paradigm, and thus becomes ensnared in it. Rather than consistently expressing contempt for the Law and refusing to engage with it, he hires a lawyer, seeks various other forms of help, and gradually becomes obsessed with his trial. Early in the novel, K. goes to see the examining magistrate; this marks his first earnest engagement with the Law and its paradigm. During the hearing, K. speaks out against the examining magistrate before a large crowd. As he criticizes the Law and its bureaucracy with increasing feeling, he becomes increasingly attuned to the crowd&rsquo;s reactions to his words:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nK. interrupted himself and looked down into the hall. What he had said was harsh, harsher than he had intended, but nonetheless accurate. It should have earned applause here and there, but all was still; they were evidently waiting tensely for what was to come; perhaps in that silence an outburst was building that would put an end to everything.\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\nHere, K. still believes in the possibility of achieving individual authority within the paradigm of the Law. He thinks that if only he speaks persuasively enough, if only he reaches enough people, he could effect significant change in the workings of the bureaucracy and so &ldquo;put an end to everything.\u201d As his argument reaches its climax, K. feels certain that the crowd is with him, but suddenly he is interrupted by a shriek from across the room. The crowd stops paying attention to him, and only then does K. see that everyone in the audience is wearing a badge. They are all officials; they were never on his side. K. does not have to agree with the Law to adopt its paradigm: as long as he takes the court seriously enough to believe that arguing his case in a hearing will mean something, he continues to relate to the law on its own terms.  Even if he engages with the Law only by disputing its authority and slandering its constituents, he remains hopelessly caught within its interpretive paradigm, at the mercy of officials who will never be sympathetic to his cause.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the end, K.&rsquo;s protestations of innocence only doom him to failure. His guilt is never defined and so can never be refuted; it is incomprehensible outside the interpretive paradigm of the Law. The idea of K.&rsquo;s innocence depends on the artificial dichotomy of guilt and innocence that is imposed upon him by the Law&rsquo;s paradigm, and so his innocence, too, remains incomprehensible outside that paradigm. If K. is to prove his innocence, he must do so on the Law&rsquo;s own terms, but on those terms K.&rsquo;s innocence is impossible: the Law is &ldquo;attracted to guilt.&rdquo; <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>",

            "rendered_content": "\r\n<p>\r\nSay you&rsquo;re walking in the market and you fall into a pit someone dug. It happens all the time. Today, you would probably go to the police and tell them about it. They would then investigate and you would go along your way. Granted, today digging a pit in a marketplace is a priori a criminalized action, but let&rsquo;s set that aside right now. Your insurance would take care of any medical bills, and later you&rsquo;d have to testify when the state brought a criminal case against the pit-digger, but the testimony would be just a formality, taking an hour or two out of your day. Imagine, however, that this happened in the ancient world. If you were a full and solvent citizen within the Roman Empire you would have to bring the pit-digger to court yourself and sue. You would also have to choose between various actions on which to sue: in this case, you would sue for negligence and maybe for insult as well. Then you would have to determine the amount in compensatory damages you wanted to try for, and justify that amount in court. Finally, you would ask for punitive damages\u2014up to four times the total compensatory damages. These punitive damages existed to serve justice to the malefactor.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlternatively, if you were a Jew of those times, you would bring the case to a <i>Beit Din</i>, a religious court, where the three rabbi judges would rule on the nature of the crime and the punishment; it would also be up to them either to award you damages or treat it as a corporal offense in the interest of God&rsquo;s justice. Here we see a great difference in the personal involvement in justice between the two ancient systems. In the Roman system, the responsibility and the authority to enforce your own society&rsquo;s ideals of justice and recompense rest upon you. In the Jewish system, your victimhood is second to the criminal&rsquo;s offense against the Lord and His Word. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOddly enough, our system, though stemming from Roman law, tends to take an authoritarian response to offenses, more similar to the Jewish system than the Roman one. Roman law provides a flexible system to deal with offenses, relying on the parties involved to bring suitable justice; Jewish law reduces all offenses to sins against a higher power. Similarly, American law these days tends to conceive all offenses as crimes against the law. For instance, take drinking and driving. If you were a Roman, you wouldn&rsquo;t drink and drive because of the risk of hurting people, who would then press charges against you and most likely win substantial amounts of your money. But as an American, you don&rsquo;t drink and drive because it&rsquo;s illegal and the police might catch you, and if they do they&rsquo;ll prosecute you simply because what you did was illegal. We no longer think about our actions in terms of social consequences, as we would in a system where justice was enforced as much by common people as by the police.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Roman and Jewish law codes of the sixth century were similarly powerful within their societies, but their legitimacy rested on very different foundations. For Roman law the source of legitimacy was public trust; for Jewish law it was God. This essential difference helps not only to explain the role of public perception for legal codes, but also to shed light on some fundamental characteristics of our own American law and how we relate to it. Though Roman law is the historical source and provides the primary framework of American law, as it does for most Western countries, the American perception of the law&rsquo;s role is in fact more akin to that of the Jews, which in my opinion is for the worse.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Code of Justinian was a sixth century, CE project by the auspicious Byzantine emperor to anthologize all relevant legal decisions, precedents, and codes to date and serve as a complete  and clear legal code that would subsume all others. For Justinian this code was to be one of his grandest achievements, together with the reconquest of Italy and the erection of the Hagia Sophia. He believed that the law was one of the greatest justifications for the very existence of the Empire. In contrast to this world-important scope of the law&rsquo;s implications, the text itself is heavily based in citizen-to-citizen interaction and conflict resolution. It lists a number of civil charges\u2014&ldquo;torts&rdquo;\u2014on which to sue in order to win personal damages, accompanied by the specification of conditions under which these actions can or cannot be applied. One of the more entertaining examples goes like this:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nFurther, Mela writes that, when some people were playing with a ball, one of them hit it hard and it knocked the hands of a barber, with the result that the throat of the slave, whom the barber was shaving, was cut by the jerking of the razor. In which of the parties does the fault lie? &mdash; for it is he who is liable under the Lex Aquilia [an action to sue for damages]. Proculus says the blame is the barber&rsquo;s, and surely, if he was doing the shaving in a place where people customarily played games or where there was much going to and fro, the blame will be imputed to him; but it is no bad point in reply that if someone entrusts himself to a barber who has his chair in a dangerous place he has only himself to blame for his own misfortune.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThe contemporary respect for Roman law was a direct result of its codification. The fact that conflict, transactions, and the very mundane interactions of life were regulated neither by the right of the stronger nor by an unreliable family or tribal system was unique and respected. The extension of citizenship during the second century CE to every free male in the empire was hailed as a great achievement\u2014and by then citizen meant nothing more, but also nothing less, than full access to the law and its remedies. Every citizen could have a reasonable expectation to justice, even against the rich and powerful. The citizen also had a wide range of options: Roman law aimed to leave as many routes as possible open for retribution so no one would leave frustrated.  The system was successful because the people used it and trusted it; the powerful submitted to it because they were invested in the success of the society the law helped to preserve.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn the Jewish side, the codification of the (Babylonian) Talmud was completed around 500 CE. It was a collection of rabbinical debate and pronouncement over all aspects of Jewish life and law based on God&rsquo;s Torah. The Talmud draws a distinction between the divine commandments (<i>mitzvoth</i>) that govern the relationship between man and God (<i>adam le&rsquo;makom</i>) and those that govern the relationships between man and man (<i>adam le&rsquo;chaveiro</i>). It is far more readily apparent when justice has been realized in conflicts between man and man than in conflicts between man and God;  therefore, the Torah and then the rabbis set up a system of rabbinical courts to adjudicate conflicts between individuals (though these courts dealt with certain enumerated religious offenses as well). In this context, the Jewish system resembles that of the Romans in that it is grounded in a set and publicly accessible law code. On the other hand, the Roman law deals primarily with justice among men, while Jewish sources primarily discuss the law as a favor handed down from God to Moses. The law is cherished as a gift from God rather than for the effectiveness or value of the gift itself.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRoman law and Jewish law diverge in practice as well as in origin, as we can see from the way in which each legal system deals with stealing in public and in private. In Bava Kamma, a tractate of the Talmud heavy in civil legal debate, the rabbis declare that it is worse to steal in private (<i>geneivah</i>) than to steal in public (<i>gezeilah</i>) because the thief who steals in private shows that he fears human vengeance more than God&rsquo;s. On the other hand, Roman commentators come to a wholly different conclusion on the subject:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nIt is useful to observe that even when there may not be an action of theft in respect of a thing deposited for safekeeping, action can be brought for robbery, because there is no small difference between an offender who steals secretly and one who commits robbery with violence &mdash; the former does at least conceal his offence, the latter not only publishes his but even commits it publicly.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThis difference can be attributed to the fact that Rome is concerned with the reputation of the law while for the rabbis the law is unassailable. The law, both criminal and civil, is nothing more than one of many institutions given to us by God to meliorate the inherently imperfect state of this world. Therefore we do not have even a right to expect justice. We must have faith that the good will ultimately be rewarded and the evil will ultimately be punished; any justice that happens in this worldly plain should be considered as an unexpected gift.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe different approaches to evidence and punishment in each legal system illuminate the practical differences between Roman and Jewish law. In criminal and especially capital crimes, Jewish law requires an extremely high burden of evidence. In order to prosecute, one must have two fully righteous male witnesses with identical testimonies, and they must have warned the suspect before the offending action by citing the relevant commandments. The witnesses were also liable to the same potential punishment as the suspect if they were discovered to be lying. Hence conviction was almost impossible. In fact, the Talmud states that if a court executed one person over a period of seventy years, it was considered a murderous court. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThough the capital crime is an extreme example, there is a general pattern of leniency throughout Jewish law. For instance, someone could never be liable for two different punishments simultaneously. If a person were prosecuted for an offense that could bring a greater punishment, he or she would also be let off automatically of the lesser offense. If the evidence was ambiguous, the accused was genereally considered innocent by default. Bava Kamma discusses the example of multiple people assaulting someone who dies. If it could be identified who dealt the last blow then that person would be liable. However, if that person could not be identified then everyone would be considered innocent. On the other hand, in the exact same situation, the Code of Justinian rules that everyone who was involved should be held accountable. This leniency in Jewish law, I believe, shows how little people were concerned with enforcing a secular appreciation for justice. People&rsquo;s frustration with lapses in justice could be denounced in appeals to piety and righteousness.  Roman law, on the other hand, was held accountable for maintaining justice and hence had to visibly enforce punishment and liability in stricter terms. Freedom of choice and trust in the courts as venues empowered the populace to be responsible for justice and feel ownership over the law.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn contrast to the Roman law, when one Jew brought another to court, the only thing he could do was present the facts of the case. The rabbis then ruled not only on guilt, but also what the offense was and any punishment to be meted out. The Jewish plaintiff had to defer to the authority of God&rsquo;s law, the rabbis&rsquo; wisdom to apply it, and the ambivalence resulting from the moral distance between the two. Because the rabbis could not claim a divine access to truth, they often deferred to God&rsquo;s justice in the afterlife.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAmerican law is truly a successor to Roman law insofar as it is preoccupied with establishing a secular rule of law, but its relationship with its public is similar to that of Jewish law. In one way it has an extreme version of Rome&rsquo;s preoccupations: it has convinced us to automatically seek litigation to settle conflicts and to trust in the law bearing fruit. As the Rabbis believed their law was unassailable, we have convinced ourselves that we must always act and consider law <i>as if</i> it were unassailable. The Enlightenment and multiculturalism have inspired our appeal to law as an appeal to the apex of reason and civilization. The judicial system still rests on an almost Kantian public faith in law and order. It is much more than a simple cool-minded calculation of happiness and stability versus freedom. People think reflexively in legal conceptions of right and wrong.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, though we now assume that everyone is capable of acting morally, we do not trust them enough to actually give them more than a minor hand in justice. We are trained when we see a crime to tell the authorities and be done with it. The police have numerous protections from the public so that they can do their work. This system, however, robs the public of any feelings of ownership of justice or fulfilled responsibility. We obey the law either through a fear of punishment or because that moral choice has been so well conditioned that it no longer resembles an ethical or moral conclusion. Instead, it rings like an automatic religious response when we defer to God&rsquo;s authority out of hand without truly considering it. We have replaced the Roman system of order and utility and inserted a god which we call the public, the people, society, or law in itself. Our legal system has become just as top-down as that of Judaism, though without the leniency that comes from the worldly authority&rsquo;s self-doubt. The rabbis always had the option of surrendering moral responsibility to God and assuming the best even in criminals. In Rome the legal system was bottom-up: even criminal action had to be brought by a complaining party to initiate any trial; the plaintiff had to dictate the damages and actions, as well as any punitive damages in the interest of justice; and authority rested on the trust and <i>active participation</i> of the people.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI do not intend to dismiss American law, nor the faith that we have in it, but we should remember that as we have adopted such a strong faith in top-down justice, it becomes more imperative than ever that that justice be applied clearly and responsibly. Today, the execution of that justice has been deferred entirely to the state. However, I must remind people that the state is imperfect and in the judiciary it is not even wholly representative. I fear that soon enough, the extreme faith we have in state-administered justice will fade. As the state becomes more distant and alien\u2014a bureaucratic entity with its own large and unique interests\u2014justice could become nothing more than reaffirming the government&rsquo;s control and jurisdiction in all affairs rather than the true interest of society. Citizens should rediscover their ability and responsibility to enforce justice through civil action and discourse. After all, the Roman law that was so dependent on its use by an active citizenry lasted so long and inspired so much respect that it still lies at the core of our own system. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>",

The two-and-a-half-week-long occupation had ended. It had served its purpose; it was an annunciation of a new movement and a new politics.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor a young leftist like myself it&rsquo;s been an exciting month, with popular revolutions throughout the Middle East and an awakening of working-class activism in the American Midwest. The tactic of occupation became central to the struggles in both Egypt and Wisconsin: Tahrir Square in Cairo and the State Capitol building in Madison. People who have never considered themselves &ldquo;political&rdquo; were all of a sudden ready to stand up to the law and even break it in order to assert their right, as &ldquo;the people,&rdquo; to speak and be heard. These occupations are now over, though there is still work to be done for these movements to achieve their aims. This essay is a first attempt at unraveling the significance of the sudden aptness of occupation in Wisconsin, and at conceptualizing the transition beyond it.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Why Occupation?</h3><br />\r\nOccupation, of the kind undertaken in Madison, is largely symbolic. It does not prevent legislators from voting, and it does not directly initiate much other organizing. What it does do is make the presence of the protestors known much better than a traditional rally does. This presence is continuous. Occupation presents a social subject who can sustain such an action and will not go away if ignored. My chief concern here is why occupation felt so natural at this moment. To answer this I&rsquo;d like to present two basic facts: who the subject of the occupation was; and why, considering the historical currents this event interrupts, the form of symbolic presence offered by an occupation was appropriate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe wrong being done by Wisconsin governor Scott Walker seems directed at a rather particular group. The cuts he&rsquo;s pushed target state-funded services and the restrictions of bargaining rights apply only to public sector unions. However, the groups Governor Walker claims he is affecting are not the same as the new subject that, through the occupation, made itself known.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWalker and rightist pundits tried constantly to divide the protestors into the legitimate and the illegitimate, and label even the legitimate as a particular segment of society. This was their general tactic: just as they claimed that only Wisconsin citizens have a right to be heard (not out-of-state protestors), they attempted to present the public sector workers, in contrast to private sector workers, as greedy and \u2018unfairly&rsquo; privileged.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe movement has consistently ignored these efforts. One poster in the capitol stated \"outside agitators welcome\" and as an outsider myself I never encountered hostility from protesters. As for the division between public and private sector workers, protest organizers insistently reframed the governor&rsquo;s actions as a broader assault. The local AFL-CIO labor council states clearly on its website, &ldquo;Make no mistake, this is only the first volley. He intends to come after private sector unions next.&rdquo; At every stage where the movement in Wisconsin could have particularized its struggle it did the opposite.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe names of two major coalitions are exemplary: &ldquo;One Wisconsin Now&rdquo; and &ldquo;We Are Wisconsin.&rdquo; Both imagine a united statewide body beyond workplace divisions or social strata. &ldquo;We Are Wisconsin&rdquo; takes this logic of unification to a forceful, sensational conclusion. This name puts forward a symbolic claim, which is not that the movement&rsquo;s opinions are what&rsquo;s best for the entire state, or that their members are from all segments of Wisconsin society. Rather, this name asserts that the movement is the state of Wisconsin, and when its members are present, the state of Wisconsin is as well. Beyond these large and well-funded organizations, the occupation in Madison also allows us to examine the sentiments of individuals in the movement through the archive of hand-made protest signs. A sign hanging from a balcony in the capitol reads: &ldquo;We Are WI >>,&rdquo; a reference to the state motto &ldquo;Wisconsin Forward.&rdquo; This re-appropriation is not simply an affirmation of pride, but a polemical announcement of being present. It is a jubilant claim of birth and fulfillment\u2014the people of Wisconsin are finally speaking up and making real a motto that was before a mere gimmick. It is also the battle cry of the people against their victimization. The wrong being done by Walker, the protesters insist, is done not merely to one part of society, but to Wisconsin as a whole.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFrom this understanding we must now ask why occupation is so suited to the unique character of a claim to be &ldquo;the people.&rdquo; To answer this we must first examine what ways of appearing as a social subject are currently dominant. The American media universe suffers from an endless performance of dialogue. This dialogue is staged between representatives of opinions that are meant to map onto every possible subject position. In order to cover the situation in Wisconsin, news programs scrambled to assemble individuals who could speak in behalf of public workers, economists, and Tea Partiers, who could enact the kind of civilized debate that our democracy was supposedly founded on. For this dialogue to be successful each major opinion must be presented. With the right collection of opinions, everything will be present. As a result it is impossible for one subject to claim to be &ldquo;the people of Wisconsin.&rdquo; If they did they would be corrected, politely, &ldquo;No, you are only one opinion among many in Wisconsin.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe occupation therefore had to find a way to present a singular subject that was not reducible to a specific opinion. It needed to create a symbolically unified voice without necessarily a unified content. This came in the form of \"the people&rsquo;s microphone.\" In the center of the building rotunda a small group of protesters got hold of a portable PA system. From the physical and acoustic center of the building they then offered the microphone to whoever wanted to speak. This meant that throughout the day the mic would be passed from teachers to police officers to students and even to outside agitators. The space reverberated with the sound of impassioned cries from people who told stories and offered analyses not as experts or representatives but individuals whose authority to speak came from their presence and the commitment it demonstrated. There was no single clear message, and no way to police what was being said, but in the pit of the rotunda the varied and contradictory voices were all welcomed equally. This trust that was created gave the speakers a sense that they all spoke together, and were all part of the same collective presence.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe space paired this with a listening process. Visitors gathered around the central balcony of the first floor, overlooking the rotunda pit where the PA was set up. Many of the thousands who passed through would stop at the balcony and listen. A new desire was forming and being fulfilled, to speak and to listen. This listening process served two purposes. First, it legitimized the speech of those at the microphone. Regardless of agreement the willingness to listen signified that the speakers were saying something worth listening to. This listening also helped unify the voice of the microphone by creating a stable spectator. Since the same people would listen for several speakers who might say wildly different things, these voices melded into one speech act. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis symbolic unification of varied opinions was also performed by the very act of occupation. An occupation must be sustained round-the-clock; this persistence produces a specific kind of appearance. It is illuminating to compare the occupation with a rally. A rally manifests its quantity, assembled towards a demand or concern announced in advance. Programmed speakers are chosen to be &ldquo;on message&rdquo; and press releases carefully lay out the opinions being expressed. After the rally disperses, the body that formed is gone. In contrast, an occupation makes this body its single, blunt claim: &ldquo;We are here.&rdquo; In ordinary civil debate, representatives express their opinion and yield the stage\u2014they are there to represent, and, having represented, go. An occupation refuses to yield the stage, no matter the characteristic politeness of Wisconsinites. An occupation, which requires massive outpouring of material support, and deep commitment, manifests a body as capable of outliving its particular manifestation. People forsake grades and even jobs to manifest this presence. This rudeness and persistence is what opens the possibility of making an outrageous claim: &ldquo;We are Wisconsin.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>After Occupation</h3><br />\r\nThe occupation is now over. An appellate court, in a single opinion, ruled that the state&rsquo;s efforts to restrict access to the Capitol were unconstitutional, praised the occupiers, and ordered them to leave. The concern was simple: the occupation was volatile and difficult to contain without violence. It had done a great deal of good, but taken a great deal of risk. Indeed, the strong impulse towards peace was increasingly strained as the days went by inside the Capitol. Now that a modicum of success had been achieved, this risk was no longer worth it. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe gesture here was essentially parental. The occupation was seen as a juvenile act, a temper tantrum of the people. Those sympathetic saw it as appropriate because of the equivalent juvenility of Walker&rsquo;s administration. The grown-up way to handle this would be to have a civilized debate and work out a compromise. In a very real sense they&rsquo;re right; precisely this, the movement&rsquo;s immaturity, must be worked through as we move forward.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBeing grown-up is an ambiguous notion. In one sense it means fitting into the established forms of social conduct. But it also means developing into a flourishing self, becoming fully &ldquo;who you are.&rdquo; The next step for the movement must be to follow this second sense. The occupation was a joyous first announcement of &ldquo;the people.&rdquo;  At every turn people said &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; expressing a relief and exuberance at finally being present.  But this must be followed by a development of this subject into its full form. This development requires a space, which the occupation initially provided, where &ldquo;the people&rdquo; can present itself. It also requires that this new subject show itself capable of doing work.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe facilitation of popular presence takes forethought. It would be feasible to create a party or organization that claims to &ldquo;represent&rdquo; the people. But political parties belong among the paraphernalia of opinion; a party merely has &ldquo;an opinion.&rdquo; On the other hand, the direct manifestation of the people is interruptive and outrageous, and takes as its medium the headlines for dramatic events. In order to have some consistent appearance beyond such events like the occupation itself, which can&rsquo;t be drawn out indefinitely, the subject announced will require a medium of presence that keeps available the <i>possibility</i> of the people appearing. Instead of creating institutions that preserve the presence of the occupation, we must create institutions that facilitate the people&rsquo;s impulse to interject through a constant reminder of its own possible appearance.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe direction following the occupation has been heartening. One group of people from the occupation have created an organization, the Autonomous Solidarity Organization, which aims at creating more sustained activities around the Capitol. They&rsquo;re capable of enduring the undramatic and dull infrastructure that will be required in their task, as is evidenced by their adoption of formal parliamentary procedure in their meetings. Thousands are being mobilized to knock on doors and stand outside grocery stores. The move to this kind of work is crucial. Here the image of participation is decidedly less sexy than occupying, but nonetheless precisely what occupation promised: the ability of a body to stick around, and to do so on its own behalf. Only this capacity for inertia, shared by parties and the institutions of opinion, will make enduringly possible the specific presence-to-itself heralded in the occupation: that of the people.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter the sexy and impressive moment of occupation I&rsquo;m making a passionate plea for tedium. This is not about cooling the fire of the movement, but making sure that fire is capable of careful and deliberate activity. We must remain playful, but become serious in our play. We must be exciting, but have poise. The occupation in Madison was a birth, and we must be sure it leads to a healthy and strong grown-up movement. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nSince juries are often considered uninspiring, I will try to grab your attention with three trivia items. One: In England, the birthplace of the modern jury system, less than 5% of criminal trials are decided by juries. Two: Jurors can rule however they wish without penalty. Three: Socrates and the Haymarket 8 were condemned by juries for their antagonistic relationship with an established order, rather than for any particular crime. The significance of the jury system is partly revealed by its role in historical controversies. When trying communists or foreigners, public jury trials have acted as an echo chamber for society\u2019s fears and biases. When policemen or escaped slaves evaded punishment, social fissures and discontent were highlighted. But despite these blemishes, throughout history the use of jury trial allowed for the direct participation of citizens in the exercise of state authority. Jury cases continue to be a tool for legitimation of the state and a key site for popular participation. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/2/nora-marcel.jpg\" width=520 class=\"picture\"><br>Illustration by <a href=\"http://noraisdrawing.wordpress.com\">Nora Whelan</a></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis essay begins with a question: if juries have played a crucial role in conflicts throughout American history, why do we consider them apolitical? From the Revolutionary to the Civil War, juries represented a form of local resistance. More recently, juries have highlighted racial and economic divisions. And although most of the important cases in American history were argued before the Supreme Court, they represented countless others in which juries had to make sense of a controversial case. You would think this history would lead Americans to consider the jury system to be an important place for citizen voices\u2014a sentiment that was expressed by the drafters of the Constitutions. But instead we tend to think that juries play only a minor role in the judicial system. We are used to thinking of the Supreme Court as the place where judicial history is made. In contrast, our vision of the jury as populated by apolitical &ldquo;everymen&rdquo; leads us to avoid jury duty, when in actuality we should welcome the power it gives us to evaluate the morality of the state. But it is notable that juries have honored the wishes of the state more often than not. The lack of deviance on the part of juries in modern times is indicative of the slow and steady devaluation of juries during the 20th century. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen the Bill of Rights was being drafted, Alexander Hamilton observed that participants unanimously agreed on the right to trial by jury, but there was some disagreement as to whether it was a &ldquo;valuable safeguard to liberty&rdquo; or &ldquo;the very palladium of free government.&rdquo; In fact, before the revolution, American resistance often took place in a legal setting, and the British had difficulty convicting American merchants and smugglers in jury trials even in the presence of clear evidence. When passing bills such as the Stamp Act, Parliament put trials in the hands of royally appointed judges. As a result, the early Americans saw trial by jury as a direct counterpart to representative governance, giving the people a clear role in the legal system alongside the political one.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe right to a jury in criminal trials was wholeheartedly supported by the American revolutionaries and enshrined in the 6th Amendment. The use of juries in civil trials, which are brought by one private party against another, was more controversial, as the Federalists worried that it would hurt the business climate of the new country. The result is a fairly significant set of differences between civil trials and criminal ones.  In most criminal trials, the jury\u2019s decision must be unanimous in order to convict the defendant.  In civil cases, the 7th Amendment has been interpreted as limiting the jury to trying facts, while the judge determines which laws are applicable to a case. Civil trials generally require only ten out of twelve jury members to reach a verdict, and loosen the burden of proof from the \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 standard. While in some cases, the parties agree to take the decision to a bench judge, jury trials are the primary recourse for any defendant. For the accused, the involvement of the jury ensures a verdict independent of the power of the state.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTrial by jury has been one of the cornerstones of American democracy from the start. It provides a direct check on the ability of the state to imprison and intimidate citizens. But the jury system is different from representation by vote in that jurors take an active role in casting judgment and curtailing the freedom of their fellow citizens. Arguably the closest analog to direct democracy in the U.S., jury trials provide legitimacy to the decision to jail, fine, or acquit individuals. As a result, juries have played the important role of providing the state with the affirmation or disavowal of the people, and have continued to shape the way the legal system works.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is the \u2018everyman\u2019 aspect of jurors that convinces us that juries are generally fair. In the most well-known movie about juries, &ldquo;12 Angry Men,&rdquo; the drama in the jury recess is partly about the evidence, partly about the juror&rsquo;s backgrounds, but in the end they make a decision that the audience considers fair. In fact, the symbolic appeal of jurors is not that they are representative of the population. Instead, when Thomas Jefferson advocates the use of juries, he points to &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; as a crucial ingredient that a group of twelve ordinary men can bring to a trial. It is trust in an everyday sense of justice and responsibility that allows us to confidently place justice in the hands of laypeople. And given the effectiveness of the jury system, this confidence is not entirely misplaced. In a jury box, people become, or appear to become, responsible, impartial judges who won\u2019t be swayed by the social status of the defendant or the prestige of the state. The belief in a fair and just judicial system is essential to the state&rsquo;s legitimacy, and the ability of jurors to take on the role of independent arbiters has ensured an equilibrium between the desires of the state and the rights of defendants.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGiven the symbolic and practical significance of juries, one would think that jury duty would be highly valued in society. Instead, strangely enough, many of us consider jury duty to be a temporary inconvenience that involves convincing the court that we are not a good fit for the case. When most of us think of juries, we think of drudgery and jury duty. In ancient Athens, a place on a jury was often seen as an annoyance. In our country today it joins voting and taxes as one of the few cases where we directly experience the state, and is considered burdensome rather than empowering. Cases seem straightforward, jury members interchangeable, and our particular role irrelevant. Our collective apathy can lead us to forget that every case is ultimately about the liberty and livelihood of the defendant. In contrast to the negative perception of jury duty, service on a jury is a source of political power and an essential right worth exercising.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBecause we closely associate juries with representative government, it may seem strange to U.S. natives that many countries in the world do not allow the laypeople involvement in the legal system. Juries are most common in countries influenced by the English common legal system, but many of those have limited the role of juries over the past century, with Israel eliminating it altogether. Most continental European countries, due to their history of civil law and strong central governments, have no jury system or a very limited one\u2014a split panel of judges and lay jurors for murder and serious crimes. In France, for example, juries have a role in some criminal cases, but they play no role in the German legal system.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA parallel to the jury system may be found in mandatory civil or military service, although this direct role in the state bureaucracy does not include a means to check its power. But civil service is being phased out in countries such as Germany, making voting rights the sole check on state power. The 20th century has seen widespread democratization based on voting rights, but this has often resulted in removal of direct participation from political and legal systems. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>In 1885, eight anarchist leaders were brought to trial in Chicago. They had organized and given speeches at an event in Haymarket Square in response to the fatal shooting of two strikers a day earlier. When police came to break up the event, a bomb was thrown, killing a policeman, and seven more died from friendly fire in the chaos. The jury was assembled by asking various businessmen to recommend employees for jury duty\u2014a normal practice at the time. All the defendants were found guilty and seven were sentenced to execution as co-conspirators, although their connection to the bombing remains highly suspect.</i>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is cases like these that make us reconsider our faith in the impartiality of jurors, randomly selected from rights-bearing members of the locality and then whittled down to remove those who may be biased in a case, have more pressing things to attend to, or are simply unfit to serve. This process acts as a shield against charges of jury bias, but some cases are so polarizing that the judgment of a jury is seen as an expression of a particular political viewpoint or class. Sometimes the claim is of bias\u2014such as O.J. Simpson&rsquo;s acquittal by a majority-black jury. The political leanings of a locality can affect a set of verdicts, such as in antebellum America when Southern juries generally convicted blacks and Northern juries generally had abolitionists mixed in who voted to acquit. In more extreme cases, such as the Haymarket Trial, the jury is accused of representing a specific section of the population. These cases indicate the ability of collective fears to break through the pretense of impartiality and amplify social injustice. When a suburban jury acquitted Sgt. Stacey Koon and three others of beating Rodney King, after the event had been captured on camera, it told the black community of Los Angeles that they were being excluded from the justice system. In an era of social conflict regarding the political, economic and legal marginalization of minorities, the courtroom drama reverberated in the wider society. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn fact, juries regularly fail to serve as an effective check on the state&rsquo;s power. The record of the state in getting guilty verdicts in cases against communists, anti-war protestors, and other groups, even in cases where evidence is limited and circumstantial, shows how jurors can give undue deference to arguments related to the necessity of preserving order. Likewise, policemen are rarely found guilty, even when they have clearly overstepped boundaries. In these sorts of cases, juries provide a buffer between the state and angry minorities in the population, giving the actions of the state more legitimacy in the eyes of the general population. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut because juries do have a disruptive potential, even if they are often conservative in their rulings, there have been attempts throughout history to marginalize the use of juries, often coupled with statements about how the use of juries will inevitably cause errors in complex cases. The 20th century has seen a shift away from the jury system in Europe, most recently in a proposed British bill that would put libel cases in front of a judge. In the U.S., one consistent source of tension has been the concern among businesses that local jurors will rule against them. The tension between local juries and evolving corporate entities was mitigated in the mid-19th century, when a Supreme Court ruling allowed corporations to send most suits brought against them to the federal circuit courts. This ruling alleviated concerns about jurors and removed a large group of cases from the ambit of the jury system.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nInstead of seeing juries as a minor part of the legal process, we should consider juries an important part of the American system of democracy. Morality and politics factor into every jury decision, and being a jury member is an important component of citizenship. What we should avoid, then, is this notion that one&rsquo;s role in the jury process is to be a cog in the engine of justice. And the jury system has indirect benefits as well, as studies have found that serving on a jury increases political participation. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is perhaps in this context that we should view the controversial doctrine that jurors should decide a verdict based on their opinion of the law in addition to the guilt of the defendant, also known as &ldquo;jury nullification.&rdquo; An inevitable result of the independence of jurors is that they can come to any verdict they wish without being penalized, meaning that a juror could acquit a defendant if they consider the defendant guilty but the law unjust. For obvious reasons, the government has been hesitant to publicize this. Judges are not required to make them aware of this possibility, and the defense mentioning it is grounds for a mistrial. The result is a tenuous balance that is an effective practical solution to the issue\u2014namely that a juror will generally only override the law if they have a strong moral case for doing to. Juries have the ability to form a check on the power of the state, but only in extreme situations.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe advocacy of jury nullification is therefore an argument for increasing the power of juries vis-\u00e0-vis the state, and recognizing that the decisions juries make are often motivated by political beliefs. It is closer to the original vision and application of juries in the early U.S. and reaffirms the romantic ideal of the jury as an essential check on state power. However, this notion can upset the carefully cultivated ideal of juror impartiality, which shields jurors from addressing the moral ramifications of their verdicts. The tenuous balance that is struck at present relies on a deliberate falsification of the role juries and courts play and have played in history. While judicial nullification is rightly controversial, it is the best way to reaffirm the courts as an organ of democratic involvement. One thing is clear: if I go into the box, I&rsquo;ll keep all my options open. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n",

According to the third Google hit for <i>damnatio memoriae</i>, a page at <a href=\"http://www.badassoftheweek.com/damnatio.html\">badassoftheweek.com</a>, the practice \u201censure[s] that the people who are complete major flaming shitburgers aren't even hatefully remembered.\u201d This idea of totally eradicating a person from memory inflames our imagination. It evokes the last scene of <i>Pan's Labyrinth</i>, in which the captain, handing over his baby son, is told \u201che will never know your name\u201d before being shot in the face.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\nIf complete removal from history were indeed the true intention of a <i>damnatio</i>, we would have to say that (at least some) <i>damnationes</i> were not at all successful. After all, two millennia later there are no gaps in our timeline of Roman emperors, though nearly half of those emperors were condemned. (Another half were deified.) We would also have to surmise that Romans recognized one another by their noses, since chiseling off the nose was the primary way that statues of the condemned were mutilated.\r\n</p> \r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/4/claire-cat.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Claire Bidwell</i></center></p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut it seems that the Romans wanted not only to declare criminals unfit to be remembered but also to ensure that they were remembered hatefully. The Senate would often order someone\u2019s portraits removed and in the same breath pronounce that person's birthday a date of ill omen (or death day a date of thanksgiving). And contemporary historians were certainly permitted to write about a recently condemned emperor as long as they wrote bad things. So the removal-from-memory side of <i>damnatio</i> was more symbolic than internet rumorists hope, and alongside <i>Pan\u2019s Labyrinth</i> it may be appropriate to imagine the scene in <i>Mary Poppins</i> in which the proprietors of Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, firing George Banks for bringing discredit upon them, solemnly punch a hole in his top hat, rip his boutonniere in two, and invert his umbrella.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p> \r\nModern misinterpretations like badassoftheweek.com nonetheless manage to capture, as Eric Varner puts it in \u201cPortraits, Plots, and Politics: <i>Damnatio Memoriae</i> and the Images of Imperial Women,\u201d \u201cthe Romans\u2019 preoccupation with the manipulation of memory and posthumous reputation.\u201d Both to assimilate and to problematize the notion of a Roman \u201cpreoccupation\u201d with posthumous reputation, consider the emperor Tiberius\u2019s refusal of a temple that would have been built in his honor. Tacitus renders Tiberius\u2019s explanation as follows: \r\n<blockquote>\r\nI am human, performing human tasks, and content to occupy the first place among men. That is what I want later generations to remember. They will do more justice to my memory if they judge me worthy of my ancestors, careful of your interests, steadfast in danger [...] Those are my temples in your hearts, those my finest and most lasting images. Marble monuments, if the verdict of posterity is unfriendly, are mere neglected sepulchers.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nRather than express admiration for Tiberius\u2019s forward-thinking attitude, Tacitus goes on to report the suspicion his speech encountered: \r\n<blockquote>\r\nSome attributed this to modesty, but most people thought it was uneasiness. It was also ascribed to degeneracy, on the grounds that the best men aimed highest [...] \u2018Augustus had done better than Tiberius,\u2019 it was said, \u2018by hoping. Rulers receive instantly everything else they want. One thing only needs to be untiringly worked for--a fair name for the future. Contempt for fame means contempt for goodness.\u2019\r\n</blockquote>\r\nPerhaps their suspicion was grounded. Why would someone refuse a temple unless he knew his unworthiness would make it look ridiculous? Or unless, through degeneracy, he did not even want to be worthy? Although Tiberius claims to hold posterity's good judgment dear, his critics seem to suspect he has opted out of striving for it. And the only natural corollary of opting out is a \u201ccontempt for goodness.\u201d Reputation and virtue thus show themselves linked.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nThere's one more thing badassoftheweek.com got right: most subjects of <i>damnatio memoriae</i> were as a matter of fact \u201ccomplete major flaming shitburgers.\u201d For just a taste, Nero's \u201cexcesses\u201d included executing just about anyone he pleased, raping just about anyone he pleased, boasting that he would kill the entire Senate, and (it was rumored) setting fire to Rome. In an attempt to restore his popularity after the fire, he tried to blame it on the Christians, but this backfired when he tortured them so horribly that everyone sympathized with them. But boundlessly powerful emperors were not the only people who underwent a <i>damnatio</i>. Conspicuous among the condemned are twenty-four women. We have to ask: what can they have done to deserve such a punishment? Some of them, daughters and wives, were executed and condemned collaterally along with the emperor. But some were condemned on their own merits. Agrippina was one of the latter.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nAgrippina committed many crimes and then met a terrible downfall. If I were asked to identify her tragic mistake, I would say: she gave birth to Nero. Even that might not have ruined her, except that she made a second mistake: she loved him very, very much. It is alleged that she asked astrologers whether he would become emperor. When they told her he would, but that he would also kill her, she replied, \u201cLet him kill me\u2014provided he becomes emperor!\u201d<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup>\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\nThis should have been difficult to achieve, considering that the current emperor, Claudius, was Agrippina\u2019s uncle, and he already had an heir, a son Britannicus, three years Nero's junior. It would have been nearly impossible unless, of course, Agrippina was to marry Claudius in spite of their close relation, arrange for her son to marry his daughter Octavia, and then murder Claudius just before Britannicus would have come of age. \r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nElsewhere Tacitus laments that he was born into an inglorious age and apologizes for the tedium of his subject matter. This was his own way of declaring some people unfit to be remembered. \u201cMy themes [\u2026] concern cruel orders, unremitting accusations, treacherous friendships, innocent men ruined\u2014a conspicuously monotonous glut of downfalls and their monotonous causes.\u201d While Agrippina may not be a shining exemplar of virtue, her story is anything but boring. Aside from the moral reasons for writing about her\u2014\u201cIt seems to me a historian\u2019s foremost duty to ensure that merit is recorded, and to confront evil deeds and words with the fear of posterity's denunciation\u201d\u2014she makes for a fascinating piece of gossip. Gossip differs from dutiful posthumous dishonoring and paints an accordingly different picture of its target. Tacitus\u2019s Agrippina bears the imprint of both. \r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\nHe reports that she was \u201cnot a woman like Messalina [Claudius\u2019s previous wife] who toyed with national affairs to satisfy her appetites. This was a rigorous, almost masculine despotism. In public, Agrippina was austere and often arrogant. Her private life was chaste\u2014unless power was to be gained.\u201d A sex life subordinated to a political life was not at odds with lethal jealousy; while married to Claudius, she was always having some woman or other \u201cstruck down because the emperor had praised her looks.\u201d Agrippina\u2019s jealousy pertained to Nero as well, of course. When his aunt tried to stand first in his heart \u201cby kind words and indulgence\u201d (Agrippina herself preferred \u201cseverity and menaces\u201d) she too was sentenced to death. Although defeating these women may have been politically necessary, just as defeating Britannicus\u2019s supporters was necessary, Tacitus often makes her look like a vessel for a demonic female passion. Avarice accompanied jealousy and was supplemented by ambition: \u201cConstantly meeting her own friends in secret, Agrippina outdid even her natural greed in grasping funds from all quarters to back her designs.\u201d The result of this half-gossip, half-incrimination is a strangely gendered mix: her \u201cfeminine jealousy\u201d and other weaknesses direct her activity, but they direct it with such totalizing urgency that she seeks the means to achieve her aims with calculating self-restraint, with \u201calmost masculine despotism.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nIt amazes us to read that her aims were radically transformed after she poisoned Claudius and a 16-year-old Nero claimed the throne. But when we look at the details, it makes sense. It came out that Nero was having an affair with a former slave named Claudia Acte. Although \u201chis older friends were not displeased to see his appetites satisfied,\u201d his mother, who, remember, had arranged his marriage to Octavia, \u201cdisplayed feminine rage at having an ex-slave as her rival and a servant girl as her daughter-in-law, and so on.\u201d Here Tacitus tries his hand at psychological insight: \u201cShe refused to wait until her son regretted the association, or tired of it. But her violent scoldings only intensified his affection for Acte.\u201d We recognize this even today as typical motherly behavior\u2014at once domineering and pathetic. But Agrippina was too clever a villain to behave ineffectually for long, in Tacitus\u2019s eyes\u2014she was as often a machine as she was an object of psychology. So when Nero began to disobey her openly, she \u201cchanged her tactics\u201d and offered Acte and Nero the use of her own bedroom for their illicit activities.\r\n</p> \r\n \r\n<p>\r\nOne day shortly afterward Nero spontaneously bought Agrippina a jewelled robe. She was ungrateful: she \u201cdeclared that her son was doling out to her a mere fraction of what he owed her\u2014all else but this one thing was kept from her.\u201d This response exasperated Nero, and he discharged her lover and greatest supporter, whom Nero had never liked anyway, from his powerful position. Now Agrippina was reduced to desperation. Her son, she began to rave, was \u201can adopted intruder\u201d who used the throne \u201cto maltreat his mother.\u201d She avowed full support of Britannicus, the rightful heir. \u201cUnshrinkingly she disclosed every blot on that ill-fated family,\u201d Tacitus says, \u201cwithout sparing her own marriage and the poisoning of her husband.\u201d She vilified herself as viciously as anyone could have; such was the extent of her ruthlessness. Her extreme, driven, and apparently self-effacing attitude, which had once been put to Nero\u2019s service, was now pointed against him.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\nThis complete turnaround highlights the contradiction in Agrippina. Her ambition, in its ability to wait and to suffer, to renounce and to destroy, is so much more than the changeable, womanish vice that steers it. I think it is this contradiction for which we should remember her. She has forgone her highest pronouncement (\u201cLet him kill me\u2014provided he becomes emperor!\u201d) and yet in attitude she remains the same (\u201cLet my reputation suffer\u2014provided he suffers!\u201d). By investing herself fully in her son, whether to help him or harm him, she has made it possible to renounce her own continuity, and security, and reputation. Along with these things, she renounces the judgment of posterity. And only a fear of posterity could have kept her vice in check.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\nEven after Nero poisoned Britannicus, Agrippina did not give up: she became Octavia\u2019s supporter against Nero and held secret meetings. This gave a former friend of Agrippina\u2019s, Junia Silana\u2014former because \u201cAgrippina had deterred a young nobleman, Titus Sextius Africanus, from marrying Silana by describing her as immoral and past her prime\u201d\u2014the opportunity to take revenge: she gathered friends to accuse Agrippina (perhaps correctly) of inciting one Rubellius Plautus to revolution. Tacitus renders her defense as follows:\r\n\t<blockquote>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\u2018Junia Silana has never had a child,\u2019 she said, \u2018so I am not surprised she does not understand a mother\u2019s feelings! For mothers change their sons less easily than loose women change their lovers. If Silana\u2019s dependants Iturius and Calvisius, after exhausting their means, can only repay the hag\u2019s favors by becoming accusers, is that a reason for darkening my name with my son\u2019s murder, or loading the emperor\u2019s conscience with mine?\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\u2018As for Domitia, I should welcome her hostility if she were competing with me in kindness to my Nero\u2014instead of concocting melodramas with her lover Atimetus and the dancer Paris. While I was planning Nero\u2019s adoption and promotion to consular status and designation to the consulship, and all the other preparations for his accession, she was beautifying her fish-ponds at her beloved Baiae.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\u2018I defy anyone to convict me of tampering with city police or provincial loyalty, or of inciting slaves and ex-slaves to crimes. If Britannicus had become emperor could I ever have survived? If Rubellius Plautus or another gained the throne and became my judge, there would be no lack of accusers! For then I should be charged, not with occasional indiscretions\u2014outbursts of uncontrollable love\u2014but with crimes which no one can pardon except a son!\u2019\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t</blockquote>\r\nThis speech sets us up to pity her: she names her irrationality outright. Lest we are overly touched, Tacitus reminds us of her calm, \u201calmost masculine\u201d side: \u201cShe demanded to see her son. To him, she offered no defense, no reminder of her services. For the former might have implied misgivings, the latter reproach. Instead she secured rewards for her supporters\u2014and revenge on her accusers.\u201d Does Tacitus\u2019s vilifying rhetoric succeed, though, in counterbalancing his and our fascination? Agrippina has renounced posterity, and Tacitus, as posterity, has castigated her accordingly. And yet, might not another slice of posterity feel differently? Not the gatekeeper of morality but the more human, the sentimental, the gossip? This contradictory woman, hard-faced even in helplessness, pierces through time to present herself to us. Centuries later, long after the Roman Empire has fallen\u2014along with its dangerous dependence on the virtues of a few individuals\u2014now, in the distant future, do we sympathize?\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\nBy then the prospect of matricide had entered Nero\u2019s head. Later, he fell in love with a woman named Poppaea who insisted he divorce Octavia, and he knew he couldn\u2019t accomplish this while his mother was alive. Rather than be so obvious as to add to the slew of poisonings\u2014or perhaps, having tried three times to poison her and realized that she had loaded her body with antidotes, as Suetonius reports\u2014he devised a scheme involving a ship that could break apart on command.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was a beautiful scene. It took place in March at Baiae, during the festival of Minerva. \u201cParents\u2019 tempers must be borne!\u201d Nero told everyone, and welcomed his mother at the shore with love and caresses. They had dinner; he pointed out the ship she would ride in, more luxurious than all the rest. Sometime during the night an informer gave the plot away to Agrippina, and she didn\u2019t know whether to believe it. Her son\u2019s attentions were too good to be true, but they were very good nonetheless. \u201cThey talked about various things; Nero was boyish and intimate\u2014or confidentially serious. When she left, he saw her off, gazing into her eyes and clinging to her. This may have been a final piece of shamming\u2014or perhaps even Nero\u2019s brutal heart was affected by the last sight of his mother, going to her death.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>\r\nTacitus believed Agrippina fell for Nero\u2019s \u201cshamming,\u201d and that it put her at ease. (\u201cWomen are naturally inclined to believe welcome news.\u201d) I prefer to believe she knew full well that she was meant to die. I like to think she perceived her son\u2019s mixture of manipulation and genuine affection\u2014and that she clung to these last moments as if they were worth whatever lay ahead.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe shipwreck was poorly enacted. Others died, but Agrippina swam to shore and was taken home. There she waited.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen her killers arrived in her bedroom, she greeted them. \u201cIf you have come to visit me, you can report that I am better. But if you are assassins, I know my son is not responsible. He did not order his mother\u2019s death.\u201d First they hit her on the head with a truncheon, then they drew their swords. \u201cStrike here!\u201d she instructed them\u2014her last words\u2014and pointed to her womb.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSuch was the kind of woman who, denounced by Nero and a Senate that feared him, made it onto the list of the condemned. Because her statues and portraits were hidden away, they remain in better condition today than they would have had she been virtuous. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\">\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nThough Suetonius has a few words to say about her in <i>Lives of the Caesars</i>, and several other accounts were lost in the folds of time, our main source for Agrippina is Tacitus\u2019s <i>Annals</i>.\r\n</div>\r\n",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nThe criminal plays an extraordinarily prominent role in our fantasy lives, given his rarity in our lived lives. Criminals occupy maybe a quarter of the evening news, and maybe a third of the movies we watch. But even this reference suggests an odd doubleness to the criminal: he (or occasionally she) is often fascinating and desirable in movies, but usually reviled in the news. This isn&rsquo;t simply a matter of hypocrisy: it&rsquo;s not that the movies express what the news doesn&rsquo;t dare to say. They&rsquo;re simply dealing with different sorts of criminals. The guilt of the movie-criminal excites us, that of the news-criminal is revolting. Of course there&rsquo;s a pleasure in hearing about the news-criminal\u2014 otherwise he wouldn&rsquo;t be on the news\u2014but the pleasure is half-masochistic horror, half-self-righteousness, and altogether not quite as much fun as the movies. The movies offer us a criminal beyond sin and beyond guilt, a smooth and fearless criminal in a well-tailored suit, a man with no regrets and no guilt; the news offers us something we know much better. The news-criminal is the sick, damaged, half-human criminal, the broken one. Criminals always pose the question of our own guilt: are we any better, are we any worse? The news-criminal does this in an obvious way: we get to feel like we&rsquo;re pretty okay\u2014or maybe just that we got away with it. The movie criminal, though, poses a stranger question: why do we admire him? What does our obedience to the law mean if we still admire the rebel? We recognize him as free\u2014free of law, but more than that, free of guilt. That we must imagine a criminal to imagine innocence says a good deal about our relation to the law.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTownes van Zandt&rsquo;s ballad &ldquo;Pancho and Lefty&rdquo; provides a perfect double portrait of the criminal: Pancho is the criminal as ideal rebel, Lefty is the criminal as dishonest scum. Pancho is the admirable, miraculous criminal, the one who lives openly outside the law, recognizing no authority\u2014&ldquo;he wore his gun outside his belt / for all the honest world to feel.&rdquo; He is the bandit, the American translation of the Satan myth: phallic as all hell, free of guilt and free of compromise. He dies as such men ought to, in a blaze of gunfire, killed by the police who can&rsquo;t tame him.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOur admiration for this kind of criminal is almost embarrassingly analyzable: he is the mirror image of our compromises, of our fear and guilt. We acknowledge laws and other unfortunate necessities, but we&rsquo;re criminals at heart and so we have a place in our heart for a certain kind of criminal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLefty is somewhat more complicated. An old associate of Pancho&rsquo;s, he fled to Ohio when the latter was killed and has been rotting away there ever since. It gradually becomes clear through implication that Lefty betrayed Pancho to the police in return for his own safety\u2014that he let Pancho die young in the Mexican desert so that he could grow old in the Cleveland winters. It also becomes clear that, far from getting away scot free, Lefty got the raw end of this deal: &ldquo;Lefty he can&rsquo;t sing the blues / all night long like he used to / the dust that Pancho bit down south ended up in Lefty&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo; The chorus of the song (&ldquo;All the Federales say / they could have had him any day / They only let him slip away / Out of kindness I suppose&rdquo;) shades gradually from cynicism to a sorrowful irony: it begins by implying Lefty&rsquo;s crime and ends up suggesting that they might have been kinder to shoot him.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLefty makes a deal with the law, betrays his companion in order to cling to his own life\u2014in order, in other words, to grow old. His reward is also his punishment. If Pancho is the realized image of our antinomian desires, Lefty is practically the opposite: he gives in, he sells out his friend merely to save his own sorry skin. But Van Zandt ends the song with a plea for Lefty: \r\n<blockquote>\r\n<i>Well the poets tell how Pancho fell<br />\r\nLefty&rsquo;s livin&rsquo; in a cheap hotel<br />\r\nThe desert&rsquo;s quiet and Cleveland&rsquo;s cold<br />\r\nSo the story ends we&rsquo;re told<br />\r\n\r\nPancho needs your prayers it&rsquo;s true,<br />\r\nBut save a few for Lefty too<br />\r\nHe just did what he had to do<br />\r\nAnd now he&rsquo;s growin&rsquo; old</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\nWe don&rsquo;t need to hate Lefty: his punishment is enough, it fits the crime. He made his deal with the law, and now he has to live with it. If Pancho is the realization of our antinomian desires, Lefty represents something much closer to home.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf Pancho is Satan, Lefty must of course be Judas. The figure of Judas is one of the great perfections of the New Testament, sketched in precisely three strokes none of which is inessential:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Judas betrays Christ for money, and for a precise sum of money: thirty pieces of silver. (Matthew 26:14-16)</li>\r\n<li>Judas betrays Christ with a kiss. His kiss is the sign with which he reveals Christ to the soldiers who have come for him. (Matthew 26: 48)</li>\r\n<li>When the necessary consequence of his action comes to pass\u2014when Christ is condemned and crucified\u2014Judas returns the money and hangs himself. (Matthew 27: 5)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nJudas betrays the Messiah (1) for a determinate quantity of worldly goods. He sells an absolutely infinite grace for a good which can be counted, and it is right that it should be counted. He betrays (2) precisely where he loves, and with a gesture of love; Christ is betrayed by an apostle, by someone who knows what he is. In the fullest sense, no one else could betray him. Most telling of all, his betrayal (3) requires no punishment, and receives none. Satan is cast out of Paradise by God&rsquo;s army, Sodom is destroyed by fire from on high, but Judas goes away and kills himself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDante assigns Judas to the lowest spot in Hell; alongside Brutus and Cassius, he ends up at the center of the ninth circle, stuck head-first into one of Satan&rsquo;s three mouths. Of course this is only right\u2014Judas is the ultimate criminal of Christendom\u2014but the Gospel&rsquo;s laconic account of his end is far more proper. Judas betrayed what he loved best, and what was most worthy of adoration; what punishment could be appropriate to that crime? Any punishment would be precisely as incommensurate and irrelevant as the reward he received. His suicide is merely the necessary consequence of his crime. In betraying Christ he betrays everything worthwhile about himself, and death is the only thing left to him.<a href=\"#ft1\" name=\"id1\"><sup>1</sup></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJudas is the opposite of a martyr. Virtually every day of the Catholic calendar is consecrated to someone who died for Christ\u2014not in order to save him, of course, but merely in order to bear witness to him. The bloodied bodies of the martyrs manifest a loyalty to something absolutely incommensurable with worldly goods. Christian ethics as a whole is polarized by this opposition between Judas and the martyr: between the one who bears witness and the one who sells out, between the faithful and the faithless. It is an ethics not of the law but of the promise. Paradoxically, in this opposition the law falls on the side of the faithless: Judas betrays Jesus to the authorities, to the Pharisees, to the lawgivers. The law isn&rsquo;t the criterion of innocence; instead, it&rsquo;s what you sell out to.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nWe usually understand guilt in relation to the law, as the consequence of a violation of the law. Guilt is what the individual feels when he violates society&rsquo;s norms\u2014that&rsquo;s what we say. But is that adequate to our experience? Is it adequate to our fantasy? Ask the question this way: who is without guilt? Who is genuinely innocent? The answer is clear: only the martyr and the great criminal are innocent, because only they resist the law. The martyr because he remains faithful to his love and bears witness, while the criminal remains faithful merely to himself\u2014but both are united in that both refuse to make a deal. It&rsquo;s surely no coincidence that the very few ethical paragons the last century offers were at once rebels and martyrs\u2014such as Martin Luther King, such as Gandhi. The test of innocence is precisely one&rsquo;s willingness to face down the law, to resist its claims and endure its punishments.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe live in a time when the law is very, very easy to obey\u2014ever less restrictive, ever less demanding. If guilt has not left us along with the law\u2014and it hasn&rsquo;t, on the contrary, it&rsquo;s ubiquitous\u2014we need to reimagine what guilt might be. We feel guilt not because we are rebellious\u2014not because we&rsquo;re Satan, Pancho, the movie criminal, the proud, cruel and independent man\u2014but on the contrary, because we are all too obedient. We love Satan precisely because we are so much closer to Judas. Freedom from guilt\u2014innocence, perhaps, or redemption\u2014is not to be found in obedience to the law, but in a martyrdom precisely against the law. Why should this be? That we know of nothing worth dying for makes the question all the more pressing. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"longhr\">\r\n\r\n<p><footnote><sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup> The psychology of Judas is, of course, strictly unthinkable; we can&rsquo;t ask why here. He betrays simply because it is necessary that we Christians understand our complicity in the crucifixion. Peter&rsquo;s pathetic denials of Christ are merely all too human, but Judas&rsquo;s betrayal is a myth. The heresies which have seen Judas as a servant of God are perhaps the best interpretations. Cf. Borges&rsquo; story on the subject, &ldquo;Three Versions of Judas.&rdquo;</footnote></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nThe target of this article is a particular attitude that has taken root, albeit in a number of divergent and often ill-defined forms, primarily among young and educated people in our society. The cynics among us have a tendency to recoil from the difficult and real circumstances of the world, with a sense that they are either too solid to be disturbed or too ephemeral to matter. Thus, there has been a collective failure to approach the issues of our day with even a gesture of seriousness. I am wagering that the reluctance on the part of radicals of our generation to engage in politics on the level of the state or the law is essentially an effect of what I will term <i>liberationism</i>&mdash;the implicit or explicit belief that the abolition of relations of domination is both necessary and sufficient to achieve positive social change. A corollary to liberationism is a certain anarchic tendency to restrict the law itself to dominating roles. Viewed in this way, any number of social problems can seem unsolvable when no such dominating relation appears to be at work. I propose that adherence to these notions is a premature surrender to reactionary forces.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy philosophical basis for alleviating this condition is a modified version of Foucault&rsquo;s views on the care of the self. In <i>Ethics: Subjectivity and Truth</i> (1984), he distinguishes between processes of liberation (<i>lib\u00e9ration</i>) and practices of freedom (<i>la libert\u00e9</i>). Liberation is the cancellation of a relation of domination, the unconditional control of the slave by the master or the colonized by the colonizer. But liberation does not specify how a person&rsquo;s existence will thereby become fruitful because it does not define &ldquo;acceptable forms of existence or political society.&rdquo; Thus, the political efficacy of a project of liberation rests on &ldquo;the idea that there exists a human nature or base that, as a consequence of certain historical, economic, and social processes, has been concealed, alienated, or imprisoned in and by mechanisms of repression.&rdquo; If liberation can defeat relations of domination, it is perhaps a prelude to something rich and positive. But by merely canceling a relation of domination, nothing concrete is achieved. Freedom must be practiced rather than possessed. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI contend that our federal government is actually the site of a potentially positive relationship between law as a social institution and freedom as a political technique. In the United States, the sphere of the state&rsquo;s involvement has, since the second half of the nineteenth century, increasingly melded with the sphere occupied by institutions of social control. That historical moment produced the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Pure Food and Drug Act. The scope and membership of labor unions increased dramatically. Such events gave institutional legitimacy to the connection between the political process and conditions of social existence (e.g. labor and capital, the use of resources, the use of urban spaces, public health). That legitimacy has only multiplied in the last century. The policy benefits of this change are obviously debatable, but the shift in the very nature of state action is unmistakable. The legitimacy of these institutional efforts feeds the play of power that produces federal policy, and in turn, that play of power renders the conditions of social existence increasingly movable and modifiable. Never before, and in no other nation, has law been the site of such painstaking negotiations, contested turfs, and shifting games of war than in the United States today.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn this context, members of the Tea Party are the uncompromising liberationists of our time. They interpret all government power relations as relations of domination. Public health care can only lead to Nazi eugenics. Public education can only lead to Stalinesque brainwashing. Today&rsquo;s right-wing anti-government rhetoric, with its paranoid attitude toward forms of social control, clearly borrows from left-wing anti-institutionalist rhetoric, which in turn is the product of a misreading of Foucault&rsquo;s account of schools, asylums, hospitals and prisons. My hope is that the reactionary vigor of the Tea Party movement will awaken us to the error that some leftists have made in denouncing all forms of &ldquo;power.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nWe must realize the irony of the fact that the history of &ldquo;emancipation,&rdquo; unlike the history of subjugation, has nearly always, but especially in the past century, occurred at the level of the law and state politics. For example, the affirmative action movement is a product of the fact that racist conditions of inequality still exist despite legal rights that were realized during the civil rights movement in the 1950s and &lsquo;60s. But although the enemy of progressive racial politics is no longer the same as it was, we have continued to formulate inequality as a problem of emancipation, invoking the rhetoric of barriers, prison cells, and oppressive laws to describe race relations in our society. (This is almost an error of language as much as it is an error of political strategy.) Of course, relations of domination still exist, and in those cases, liberation is the correct rhetorical and institutional strategy to pursue. But when we approach a persistent social problem, we tend to move the goalposts in order to continue defining our agenda as emancipatory. We explain the persistence of such problems as a result of the refinement of technologies of domination. But there is no reason to believe that all conditions which we oppose&mdash;of injustice or inequality or suffering&mdash;can be addressed in terms of liberation. School integration in the South could not have been achieved simply by repealing segregationist laws; Brown v. Board of Education did not define acceptable practices in civil society. Students had to be brought to school on federally mandated buses, protected from harassment by National Guard units. The political reality of integration was not consistent with the rhetoric of liberation that accompanied it. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn our society, any real, practicable freedom entails the capacity to participate autonomously in public matters, a capacity which has yet to be fully and universally realized. Again, processes of liberation alone fail this standard. Traveling in and around the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, for instance, is often complicated by the geographic layout of the neighborhood. Many streets either end in a &ldquo;T&rdquo; and then pick up again a couple of blocks later, or are blocked by parks or buildings. It is a widespread belief, and apparently true, that this layout was put in place in the middle of last century to make it more difficult for poor and/or black residents of the surrounding neighborhoods to enter the whiter and more middle-class Hyde Park. This, to me, is an instance of oppression that could theoretically be ameliorated by quite literally removing the barriers. But even if the barriers were removed, I imagine the liberationist argument would respond that the autonomy of the underclass pedestrian is still denied (repressed, imprisoned, blocked) by the gaze of the Hyde Park pedestrian. That may or may not be true, but can&rsquo;t we agree that once the original object of protest has folded, the problem must be re-assessed? How can any person expect to exercise autonomy when they&rsquo;re constantly trying to locate an invisible master to whom they&rsquo;re enslaved?\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEven laws whose technical function is to place restraints can actually cause the proliferation of desirable practices. For example, we have anti-discrimination laws that govern all entities that operate in the public square, regardless of ownership. The left-wing critique of liberal anti-discrimination policies is concerned with the themes of repression and imprisonment, which only serve to make race, class, gender and any other identity into pathologies. It proposes no solution at all. The right-wing critique of anti-discrimination laws, that it imposes a burden on communities that should be allowed to resolve their problems organically, makes a different liberationist error. It assumes that social and political practices are an expression of cultural values, rather than potentially a means of producing or changing those values. The juridical code imposed by such laws demands that we imagine egalitarianism. By asserting their effectiveness, I am in a sense defending the notion of &ldquo;abstract equality,&rdquo; which has been criticized as a <i>barrier</i> to real equality. But why can&rsquo;t a discourse of equality be part of egalitarian practices? Indeed, anti-discrimination can serve as an incitement both for the dominant culture to form links with countercultures, and for subcultures to develop their own communal infrastructures and cultural identities, along with mastery of the sphere in which social and political capital circulate. These goals are just a handful of many possible routes that freedom could take; the point is that none of them can be achieved within a solely emancipatory political strategy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAdmittedly, it is much more difficult to schematize or theorize these routes to freedom in the way that liberationism has schematized politics, because for freedom, the goal must inform the tactic. Unfortunately I cannot give a definitive statement of any such theory, but I will use the balance of my article to point us in what I believe to be right direction. This will take the form of an <i>ethics of the law</i>, a deliberate system of action by an individual to influence the course of politics.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLiberationism denounces barriers, but it limits itself to combating those barriers only by <i>blocking</i> their exercise or expression. Canonical U.S. history teaches us that the 1787 Constitution placed fewer constraints on the powers of the central government than the earlier Articles of Confederation. In its day, the Constitution was roundly denounced by more than a few as merely a <i>new kind</i> of tyranny. (To a critic of leftist liberationism, this logic rings eerily familiar.) But today&rsquo;s conservatives hold up the Constitution as the embodiment of limited government. Thus, the language of liberation/domination&mdash;limit, preservation, oppression, repression, imprisonment, tyranny, checks and balances&mdash;runs up against a glaring inconsistency when it bases political action on abolishing constraint, but can only answer it with opposing forms of constraint.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo properly practice freedom, we must formulate a political ethic that can actually produce desired effects autonomously, that is, without constant reference to its opponent. Both right-wing constitutionalism and the left-wing retreat from state politics conceptualize a passive public of immobile subjects. Any discourse that opposes &ldquo;the state&rdquo; and &ldquo;the people&rdquo; assumes that individuals have a minimal impact on the course of their own government and must be protected by the state. An attentive conception of the law requires, first, a new conception of this subject. To state the obvious, a powerful government cannot rule over free people unless the people are free to control the course of the government. The Constitution clearly intends for us to practice that freedom, and it identifies the circumstances of its exercise. Policy debates often take up the question of how our electoral process can better reflect the public interest. But elections are merely one rather feeble way in which a conscious citizen practices political freedom. The supreme ethical program available to the political subject is the manipulation of the legal infrastructure under which state affairs are conducted. Currently, lawyers are the only full practitioners of that ethical program. The professional practice of the law, which trains individuals not to extract underlying truths from a text, nor to unveil the collective psyche, but to use text as a tool in the pursuit of a juridical outcome, ought to be the model for the actions of all citizenry.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOur generation is disenfranchised by our own disdain for national politics as such, for the Democratic Party, for liberal policymakers, liberal organizers, and union bosses. All of their efforts seem to serve only as their own eventual downfall and so we have withdrawn from those spheres. Although the conduct and professional mindset of a lawyer are stereotyped by our culture as crudely opportunistic, we ought to embrace the potential that those stereotypes hold: despite our disdain, as a generation, for state politics, we are remarkably well-attuned to the value of disciplined attention to the consequences of our actions. We have the ideological conviction, the advanced technology (in the general sense of tools) and the social training to enact such a deliberate system of action. This is as far as I am prepared to take us at the moment, but I ask you to imagine what might be possible if every citizen were also a lawyer. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>",

It turns out the friend has gotten super into hallucinogens, and after they both had a few beers one thing led to another and Dennis dropped LSD for the first time since he was 23 and for the third time in his life. Now he&rsquo;s at work, and these green devils keep flickering across one of his security cameras. The crazy thing is, the camera is black and white, but he&rsquo;s having trouble convincing himself of that, or even believing in the system of classification that excludes the colors he&rsquo;s seeing from the category &ldquo;black and white.&rdquo; Occasionally his eyes drift over to the tabloid magazine spread out on the counter and he wonders if it could somehow help him.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Frank. Frank has just decided five seconds ago to become a poet. He understands, in a way that dwarfs all previous understandings he&rsquo;s ever experienced, that God has chosen him to restore radiance to a faded world. Radiance is the key. He&rsquo;s not sure if any non-poets will understand what he has to say, but at the moment he feels like he&rsquo;d commit any crime rather than the unspeakable sin of staying a security guard and withholding his good news from the world of letters. He wonders if the occasional students wandering past him into the library notice the beatific expression on his face, and if so whether some glimmer of the light shining out of his open face has kindled a sympathetic light in their souls.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Luis. Every second of life is a new wave breaking over Luis&rsquo;s oversensitized body. If the waves stop, he thinks he might cease to exist. The boiling sunlight rinsing across his face has nothing at all to do with the cold Massachusetts winter transpiring outside his windows, or perhaps outside his body, he can&rsquo;t tell. He waves a car through the open gate and the motion of his hand is the sum of the force of the waves and the energy of the sinusoidal sun rays reaching his face after journeying past eternity.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Petar. Petar is staring at a black spot on the ceiling that has fascinated him for what seems like hours by not moving at all. He has carefully removed his shirt, shoes, and pants in order to feel less encumbered, and in one out of every few cars that drives by his windowed compartment a driver glances over and wonders whether to call someone. Every so often Petar contemplates calling someone too, someone who could relieve him of his responsibilities so he&rsquo;d be free to find the place he ought to be, which he thinks might be either the hospital or a movie theater.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Jeff. Jeff is nervous, because he reckons it&rsquo;s been about an hour since he called his friend Lester and Lester&rsquo;s still not here. Jeff is really eager to show Lester a pattern of colors he&rsquo;s figured out that corresponds to the sequence of psalms, and he also needs Lester&rsquo;s help escaping the utilities closet he&rsquo;s trapped in. Jeff isn&rsquo;t sure he wants to leave, since there&rsquo;s a reason he locked himself inside in the first place, but there&rsquo;s only one thing left to do in a room when you&rsquo;ve already entered it, and he&rsquo;s eager to get on with it. He wishes there were a window but at the same time he wouldn&rsquo;t want the world to be exposed to him just now, even through a pane of glass.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Owen. Owen is using half his attention to count the number of days he&rsquo;s been at work high, drunk, tripping on acid, and sober. High is winning by a lot. Tripping is tied with sober unless ecstasy counts as acid, in which case tripping is in second place. The other half of Owen&rsquo;s attention is occupied by his headphones, which are attached to his iPod, which is attached to his generation, which is attached to the earth, which is attached to the universe, which is attached to God.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Mario. Mario is just standing there staring at the punk kid approaching him. He doesn&rsquo;t think he can handle being challenged right now, and his mental fragility is threatening to unbalance him emotionally. Mario&rsquo;s mouth feels like a jungle and his skin feels like it&rsquo;s made of rainbows. He hopes his knees don&rsquo;t suddenly disappear. He hopes the kid is just his imagination. He hopes the gun in his holster is just his imagination. He hopes that if he somehow has to shoot the kid, at least one out of the kid and his gun is just his imagination. He&rsquo;s not sure if anything that&rsquo;s happening matters and he has no idea how he could possibly figure it out.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Vitaly. Right now Vitaly is mostly possessed by the personality of his boss, a contractor hired to provide security at a summer music festival. His boss is extremely unhappy at Vitaly for three reasons. First, Vitaly accepted drugs from concertgoers, which brings his boss to the brink of tears with misery. Second, Vitaly hasn&rsquo;t called his girlfriend in three days, and his boss questions if Vitaly really wants to ever see her again. Third, Vitaly&rsquo;s cousin helped him cheat on a taxi driver&rsquo;s examination seven years ago, and the fact that no one ever found out seems to cast doubt on the existence of government. What if it doesn&rsquo;t exist, but we make it exist just by thinking it exists? That would explain the lack of enforcement of rules, Vitaly&rsquo;s boss points out, and Vitaly can&rsquo;t think of any reason to agree or disagree.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Neal. Neal blinks at the small child standing by the door. Is it a small child? Or maybe that&rsquo;s just how big people are? The child asks him something but Neal could sooner read Egyptian hieroglyphics than grasp whatever it is he&rsquo;s saying, although he can repeat it in his head over and over until any sense inherent in the words has surely been worn away. Neal&rsquo;s position of authority as the school&rsquo;s guardian of order weighs heavily on him. He wonders if he&rsquo;ll ever feel normal or competent again but isn&rsquo;t sure why communicating with small children is so important that he&rsquo;d ever miss the ability to do it.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Stefan. Stefan has not done LSD, as far as he knows. He suspects the world is playing some sort of trick on him. All along the perimeter of the Rolling Hills Club, faces are appearing in trees and plants, mostly children&rsquo;s faces, mostly distorted with inhuman expressions. They&rsquo;re still on the other side of the fence, but they keep threatening to swarm through onto the golf course. Stefan doesn&rsquo;t know what he would do if that happens, because he&rsquo;s sure he couldn&rsquo;t outrun them, especially with all the feet growing out of their mouths.  <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></li>\r\n\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p class=\"picture\"><center><img src=\"/media/images/2/nora-sam.jpg\" width=520 class=\"picture\"><br>Illustration by <a href=\"http://noraisdrawing.wordpress.com\">Nora Whelan</a></center></p>\r\n",

            "rendered_content": "<p>(Spike warning: this article treats themes that might be triggers for a lot of HOCD sufferers. Much of the article is a defense against pretty ridiculous suspicions, which are nonetheless alarming. I also, with some reluctance, have chosen to make specific substantive claims about the disorder itself; but if my interpretation of the disorder somehow clashes with your own, feel free to ignore me. As usual, you&rsquo;re the expert.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My <a href=\"http://hypocritereader.com/1/glossary-of-sexual-doubt.html\">article</a> last issue presented a little-known but probably wide-spread disorder, HOCD, and a few theses about the tactical context of its terminology. If you haven&rsquo;t read it, and haven&rsquo;t heard of HOCD, I recommend glancing at <a href=\"http://www.brainphysics.com/yourenotgay.php\">Mark-Ameen Johnson&rsquo;s</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ocdonline.com/articlephillipson7.php\">Steven Phillipson&rsquo;s</a> excellent introductions before reading on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my glossary entries for &ldquo;Denial,&rdquo; &ldquo;Reassurance,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Groinal Response,&rdquo; I argued that the HOCD community&rsquo;s homegrown concepts function as a cure by disarming concepts that reinforce obsessive questioning, e.g. &ldquo;repression&rdquo; and &ldquo;denial.&rdquo; These latter, along with their clich\u00e9s and dramatizations, must be seen as part of the disorder&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiology#Medicine\">etiology</a>.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I didn&rsquo;t say whether spike-inducing concepts like &ldquo;denial&rdquo;  are by themselves sufficient to explain where the disorder comes from. The concept of denial is ubiquitous, but not everyone suffers from HOCD. I was avoiding an obvious question: why the people who get HOCD get it. This omission was the first of several my non-HOCD readers perceived; it inflamed their suspicion. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many non-HOCD readers seemed to see HOCD as a kind of sexual insecurity, which was taken, predictably, as evidence of a sexuality that was itself insecure, unstable, and volatile. By contrast, an ease and comfort in sexuality would seem to confirm a kind of sturdy, adult straightness. This straightness would explain their lack of disorder. It followed that the cause of HOCD was really homosexuality.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, inquiry into etiology is legitimate and scientific. To that extent it may seem that I, avoiding the question, ceded scientific thoroughness to my suspicious non-HOCD readers who not only asked it but rapidly answered. In fact this appearance is misleading, for three reasons. Firstly, the etiology of OCD in general is, at present, known only vaguely. It has to do with chemicals, according to experts. And HOCD, whatever the sexuality of sufferers, is very clearly a kind of OCD according to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders\">DSM</a>. So this omission isn&rsquo;t remarkable: it&rsquo;s common to write about the features of OCD experience without reciting whatever vague allusions to chemicals make up our present knowledge of its etiology.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, these suspicions do not draw their plausibility from any scientific discourse on OCD, or even on common sense about OCD. Indeed, they are nonsensical when applied to other forms of OCD. Let&rsquo;s see how it sounds: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help but thinking that there must be some reason why you, of all people, obsess about leaving the gas on. After all, I have a gas stove as well. Couldn&rsquo;t it be that, in truth, you have left the gas on?&rdquo; What&rsquo;s the difference between homosexuality and leaving the gas on? (Begs for a punchline: &ldquo;When you leave the gas on, your house doesn&rsquo;t explode.&rdquo;) The difference is that we're used to the idea that people &ldquo;deny&rdquo; and &ldquo;repress&rdquo; homosexuality, and we're used to the idea that homosexuality is horrible enough that you'd want to do so. To some extent this suspicion works for harm-OCD: we might suspect that somebody who obsesses about hurting another person does so because they secretly want to. But in both cases these intimations are tenuous, despite their ability to take on such an authoritarian character. The fact that some people might want to repress their homosexuality and even succeed in doing so doesn&rsquo;t mean that everyone on earth is in denial.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, there are other, very obvious, explanations for HOCD besides homosexuality. Even if we leave out chemicals and predispositions, which probably play a decisive role, there are cultural factors. Boys who like girly things are usually assumed to be gay. Girls who like masculine things are called lesbians by their classmates. Asexual adolescents and adults are sometimes advised to &ldquo;figure out&rdquo; &ldquo;whatever&rdquo; is &ldquo;going on&rdquo; with them. But do these assumptions make any sense? To say to an asexual woman: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to have sex with men, therefore you want to have sex with women.&rdquo; No! None of it makes any sense! But it&rsquo;s still fatally compelling and confusing for effeminate boys, boyish girls, asexuals, and anybody else outside the norm. Their weirdnesses get confiscated and assimilated into our culture&rsquo;s big binary obsession, straight/gay, which is where they're told to look for them. So they look, and those susceptible do so obsessively.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question, &ldquo;Why do these particular people get HOCD, but not everybody?&rdquo;, is no more portentous than similar questions about, e.g. insomnia, susceptibility to addiction, or OCD in general. If my readers' suspicions about etiology are so unscientific, maybe that&rsquo;s because they're really standing in for another question that&rsquo;s far more titillating, but too gossipy to be asked directly. A lot of non-HOCD readers expressed, more or less politely and euphemistically, their confusion about what HOCD &ldquo;is.&rdquo; Some asked me outright. What everybody wants to know about HOCD is, are they gay or not?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my article, I ignored this question on purpose. But it was a mistake not to have justified this omission. There&rsquo;s something here that can&rsquo;t be left both unasked and undiscussed. It begins to ask itself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My failure to pose this question is also controversial from the point of view of the HOCD community. I&rsquo;d like to justify myself to them first (I&rsquo;ll speak to a broader audience below.) On HOCD forums, it is generally held that sufferers are by definition not gay. There is a therapeutic utility to defining HOCD in opposition to homosexuality, but doing so has the structure of reassurance and the same drawbacks. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It might be useful at a certain point in the spike-cycle. A sufferer might be aware of the fact that they&rsquo;re thinking disorderedly, but still suspect that they&rsquo;re gay. At such a moment, it will be reassuring to them to hear (A) that their confusion and disorderedness is part of a disorder called HOCD, and that (B) having HOCD means you aren&rsquo;t gay. Phew.\r\nBut as always, reassurance is double-edged. First, because the sufferer will at some point realize that nobody has scientifically demonstrated that having HOCD means you&rsquo;re not gay. Second, because the opposition of HOCD to homosexuality leaves two options, and sufferers might not be able to diagnose themselves with confidence. Many with HOCD have been convinced, at some time or other, of the reality of their homosexual arousal. At such moments, a two-option <a href=\"http://www.neuroticplanet.com/hocd.php\">chart</a> tells them that they don&rsquo;t have HOCD, depriving them of all the concepts that have made their experience intelligible and allowed them to escape from the obsessive logic of &ldquo;denial&rdquo; and &ldquo;repression.&rdquo; Uncertainty is part of the disorder, so if being uncertain interferes with sufferers' use of the label &ldquo;HOCD,&rdquo; that label is unusable for sufferers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnother reason not to define HOCD in terms of the sufferer&rsquo;s sexuality is that the label can be useful to people who actually do consider themselves gay or bisexual. All the symptoms of HOCD can be present: reassurance cycles, spikes, and checking. Consider, for example, a self-identified gay woman who chooses not to have sex with other women. This shouldn&rsquo;t seem far-fetched; people can choose what to do with their bodies, and there are plenty of reasons why someone might be abstinent. This person, whose life may be quite exciting and interesting to her, might begin to worry that her desire will get out of control, that it will force her to do something she doesn&rsquo;t want to do. She may begin to monitor her arousal, checking obsessively to see if it is increasing or spiralling. At times she may suffer debilitating attacks of obsession, spend hours in solitary &ldquo;checking,&rdquo; or ask her friends for reassurance, repeating the same questions day after day. None of this will be unfamiliar to straight HOCD sufferers, who also worry that their desire will explode, that they will do something they don&rsquo;t want to do, etc. And a person like this might really benefit from the anti-obsessive ideas developed by the HOCD community. She could be told that her obsession is not proof that her desire is exploding; that she should stop checking, and stop asking for reassurance. It&rsquo;s extremely important not to exclude from our definition of HOCD people who obsess about the sexuality that they identify as having. They need the concept too, and there&rsquo;s room for them. It&rsquo;s better for sufferers, straight- and gay-identified, if we define the concept of HOCD symptomatically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy main concern is to maintain the usability of the concept for sufferers. And for reasons I discussed above, taxonomies based on the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; of the obsessive idea are inherently unusable for sufferers. For this reason, it&rsquo;s best to define HOCD by its symptoms, without reference to the sexuality of the sufferer. That&rsquo;s why, in an article introducing and presenting the concept of HOCD, I avoided posing questions about  sufferers' &ldquo;true desire.&rdquo; Instead, I discussed symptomatic regularities like &ldquo;spiking,&rdquo; &ldquo;reassurance&rdquo; cycles, &ldquo;groinal responses,&rdquo; and &ldquo;checking&rdquo; (see my <a href=\"/1/glossary-of-sexual-doubt.html\">glossary</a> for more on these terms.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut, though I prioritize the use of these concepts to sufferers, I&rsquo;m sure members of the HOCD community will also be interested in what I would say to outsiders. After all, if they ever choose to discuss their HOCD publicly, they might have to justify themselves to skeptics. Before I return to the question &ldquo;Are they gay or not?&rdquo;, this time for a non-HOCD audience, I&rsquo;d like to address another source of skepticism. Some among my non-HOCD audience may mistrust my insistence on &ldquo;utility to the sufferers&rdquo; and &ldquo;self-treatment&rdquo; as criteria of diagnostic categorization. It may seem like a &ldquo;vicious relativism&rdquo; that undermines the idea of scientific psychology. Indeed, where utility is concerned, usefulness for therapy is probably prioritized over usefulness for self-treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nScientific rigor and utility in therapy are perfectly legitimate objectives, and I&rsquo;m not trying to undermine them. But they needn&rsquo;t prevent us from recognizing self-treament as an equally legitimate purpose. The HOCD community has found a use for this homegrown diagnostic category that remains just as valid as any other. Suppose, for example, that a more complicated category were useful in therapy. Some people may still prefer self-treatment, for a number of reasons\u2014some people prefer to treat themselves, and it can be hard to find a therapist. And the support of the HOCD community is helpful even to people in therapy. For these reasons, the &ldquo;wild&rdquo; concept of HOCD, so useful in self-treatment, remains indispensable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI would also claim something more controversial. I think the usefulness of the concept of HOCD, especially in self-treatment, should trump any questions about its validity or accuracy. Given that the concept of HOCD is meaningful and even vital to many sufferers, I don&rsquo;t see how it would be okay to deprive them of this category, even if it lacked scientific rigor. The privileges of truth should not go unquestioned, especially when they justify harm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI&rsquo;m not saying specialists should stop developing concepts that are useful for therapy, or stop pursuing the truth. Nor are these endeavors unwanted\u2014I think everybody in the HOCD community wishes psychiatry would catch up with them. But it&rsquo;s important that the HOCD community&rsquo;s self-understanding be respected. They know enough to decide what concepts work for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOf course, members of the HOCD community, tending as they do to obsess about self-knowledge and truth, won&rsquo;t find these defenses particularly reassuring. To some extent that&rsquo;s good: reassurance, we all know, undermines itself. Being cured of obsession means being able to stop asking questions, giving oneself permission to stop trying to verify or uncover the truth. They have a community now, so if they stick together they can resist corrosive and invasive queries from without.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe paradigmatically invasive and corrosive question is the one we were just discussing: &ldquo;Are they gay or not?&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve already argued that HOCD sufferers don&rsquo;t need to worry about this question, and that it&rsquo;s better if they stop asking it. But in practice it&rsquo;s often difficult to ignore other people&rsquo;s skepticism, even with the help of a community. So I&rsquo;d like to offer three further arguments for ignoring this question and any outside attempts to answer it. Unlike my reasons above, these three arguments are not therapeutic recommendations, but are based on weaknesses in the question itself, and are relevant to anyone from the non-HOCD world who wants to understand the disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFirst of all, the question &ldquo;Are they gay or not?&rdquo;, is almost harmless by itself. It only seems so portentous, to sufferers and to the rest of the population, because it is buttressed by a host of weighty assumptions that should themselves become questions. Suppose sufferers are gay\u2014then what? Does unacknowledged desire necessarily explode? Do resisted urges build up and damage a person? Or are they dangerous to others? Does celibacy mean an unhappy life? Does celibacy mean an empty life? Is self-knowledge indispensable to happiness? Is self-knowledge indispensable to individuality, creativity, and growth? Is self-ignorance pathetic? Does self-ignorance necessarily lead to conservatism and homophobia? Are unscientific ideas more politically hazardous than scientific ideas? Does self-defense produce weakness? These questions, ranging over philosophical, moral, and dramatic registers, lurk unasked in the background of the question, &ldquo;Are they gay or not?&rdquo; What&rsquo;s remarkable is that, HOCD sufferers, far from shirking inquiry, are among the few who ask these neglected questions. They conduct this research experimentally, constantly, and often unconsciously, because they have to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe fact that HOCD sufferers are among the few who think critically about this background of philosophical, moral, and dramatic assumptions (and they do so with their whole existence), is indicative of a second cause for optimism. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if outsiders ask or answer the question &ldquo;Are they gay or not?&rdquo;, because they&rsquo;re not usually knowledgeable enough to do so. HOCD sufferers know things about sexuality that the rest of the public does not know. So they have a reason to be skeptical of what other people say. And they should be equally savvy about any research on HOCD that isn&rsquo;t conducted by affiliates of the HOCD community (such as Monnica Williams and Steven Phillipson.) We&rsquo;ve seen enough examples of dogmatism and ignorance masquerading as psychology. Specialists have a lot to learn from the HOCD community before the community will have anything to learn from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA third reason to ignore the question &ldquo;Are they gay or not?&rdquo;, is that this question is unscientific and nonsensical. Earlier, discussing HOCD&rsquo;s cultural etiology, I analyzed the way every departure from the norm gets confiscated and assimilated into the straight/gay binary. I&rsquo;d like to expand this critique by way of a somewhat long digression, because I want to acknowledge two very illuminating responses I received to my article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe first is that of Mark-Ameen Johnson, a NeuroticPlanet member who wrote one of the first and best <a href=\"http://www.brainphysics.com/yourenotgay.php\">pieces</a> available on HOCD. He pointed out a serious error in the &ldquo;HOCD&rdquo; entry of my glossary. That section includes a very inane table mapping sexual orientation to HOCD: there are straight people who worry about being bi, straight people who worry about being gay, bi people who worry about being straight, bi people who worry about being gay, gay people who worry about being bi, gay people who worry about being straight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe problem with this table is that it seems to be complete, but isn&rsquo;t. Mark pointed out that I&rsquo;d left out <a href=\"http://www.asexuality.org/en/\">asexuals</a>. First, there are aromantic asexuals, who are interested neither in romance nor in sex, and probably get HOCD a lot because, in our culture, we often interpret the absence of heterosexual desire as a sign of homosexuality. I also left out hetero-romantic asexuals, who want romance but are not interested in sex; they interpret it as a sign of homosexuality. And I also left out homo-romantic asexuals, who like romance with people of the same sex but aren&rsquo;t interested in having sex with them. Mark told me he&rsquo;d talked to one homo-romantic asexual who started to fear that he would have sex with men. There are almost certainly homo- or bi-romantic asexuals who&rsquo;ve engaged in the same obsessive &ldquo;checking&rdquo; that characterizes HOCD in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere&rsquo;s where the second response comes in. A friend of mine told me, after reading my article, that he&rsquo;d had HOCD in middle school. He said it started because he was attracted to girls in an &ldquo;idiosyncratic&rdquo; way, one that wasn&rsquo;t included in the discourses on sexuality he was offered. By leaving out so many groups from my table, I may have reproduced this confusing exclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo I&rsquo;d like to redo my table. This time my table won&rsquo;t corral everything onto one tyrannical axis (gay - bi - straight); in fact these groups don&rsquo;t seem to fit on any axis at all. And, most importantly, this time it won&rsquo;t pretend to be exhaustive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI should make a short disclaimer, however. I'm not laying these categories out as some new means of reassurance, even though some of them can offer alternative interpretations of &ldquo;signs&rdquo; of homosexuality. As I've said before, I don&rsquo;t think a more scientific or accurate system of analysis is helpful for sufferers. What&rsquo;s more important for HOCD sufferers is the ability to stop questioning their &ldquo;true sexuality&rdquo; whenever the pursuit of this truth becomes obsessive. As long as sufferers understand that it&rsquo;s their right not to do anything that they don&rsquo;t want to do, and that their desire is not a time bomb, they shouldn&rsquo;t need any reassurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt may be, of course, that sufferers fall into a number of sexual groups at once, and have different relationships towards each desire. In that case, broadening this list may help them articulate their comforts and anxieties more subtly; it could be, for example, that a woman is perfectly comfortable with desire for other women, but frightened by the idea of romantic feelings for them. Or the other way around\u2014both romance and physical attraction are possible sites for HOCD. It might be helpful to such a person to be able to articulate the fact that she&rsquo;s okay with same-sex physical desire, but not with same-sex romance, which she can choose not to worry about. Hopefully a more realistic and nuanced table of sexualities will facilitate such understandings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut my main purpose in developing this table remains the following: to demonstrate that the simplistic question &ldquo;Gay or not?&rdquo; is awkward and unscientific.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People of the following additional tendencies can all suffer from HOCD, for a number of reasons greatly in excess of the ones I will occasionally point out:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Straight people</li>\r\n<li>Bi people</li>\r\n<li>Sadists, masochists, and people with any other fetish: when such people &ldquo;find out&rdquo; that they lack interest in normal straight sex, they, like my friend, very often assume it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re gay. Then as soon as they &ldquo;resist&rdquo; this possibility, the whole machinery of suspicion kicks in and tells them they&rsquo;re repressing, latent, in denial, etc.</li>\r\n<li>People who consider themselves to be homosexual. They can also obsess about their own sexuality in many of the ways open to straight sufferers.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>People excited by the idea of having dark secrets, who enjoy being frightened by their desire; phobosexuals. It might not matter what the secret is. It should just be overpowering and catastrophic. So when such people imagine themselves being &ldquo;in denial,&rdquo; they get excited or aroused, without necessarily wanting to do the things that frighten them. And moreover, they might be unable to separate these exciting thoughts from the fantasy of being destroyed. But this isn&rsquo;t really such a baleful way to enjoy, and phobosexuality can be as quotidian and undramatic as any other.</li>\r\n<li>People who prefer to fantasize things than to do them. Even hetero-fantasizing asexuals might get HOCD because it&rsquo;s weird not to want to have sex. Homo-fantasizing asexuals probably get confused too, thinking they should force themselves to &ldquo;live it out.&rdquo;</li>\r\n<li>Teases. There are lots of asexuals who are not interested in romance, but are really into sexual tension and attention, and the fun and danger of flirting. There are, to name a few varieties, homo-tease asexuals, hetero-tease asexuals, bi-tease asexuals, and maso-tease asexuals. People treat teases pretty brutally sometimes. Hetero-tease asexuals are often punished with accusations of frigidity or homosexuality. Homo-tease asexuals (who are often otherwise straight) might also be punished through similarly shaming accusations,  in any case are often unequipped to recognize their desire as anything but genitally homosexual. In some, such confusion becomes HOCD.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the hetero-oriented sexualities in this list is perfectly compatible with HOCD. And each homo-oriented sexuality raises questions for anyone still asking &ldquo;Are they gay or not?&rdquo; For example: are homo-romantic asexuals and teases gay? Or not? What about people who just enjoy being found attractive by people of the same sex? Are they gay? Or not? We&rsquo;re not talking &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no,&rdquo; or even about &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; or a &ldquo;continuum&rdquo; here. The differences involved here are unrelated to straight/bi/gay: what sex means to different people, whether consummation is important or possible for different people, whether arousal builds towards a climax or is sprinkled through the most quotidian activities, whether pleasure is pleasant or not, whether desire is realistic or literary, what kind of feelings accompany it (self-affirmation? affection? greed? guilt? anger? fear? vulnerability?), how people prefer to indulge in their desire, e.g. alone or socially, physically or mentally... But the sexuality of sufferers is no more complicated than that of the general public, and the question &ldquo;Are they gay or not?&rdquo; is stupid, simplistic, and unscientific whoever it&rsquo;s applied to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOCD sufferers are, nonetheless, among those at the forefront of such researches. Many have already discovered that, if they do choose to interrogate their desire, straight and gay aren&rsquo;t the only possibilities. It&rsquo;s okay to be arbitrary, creative, or playful about sexuality, to invent new categories without being sure they fit exactly. After all, gay/bi/straight don&rsquo;t fit and are unscientific, so what&rsquo;s the worse that could happen?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI&rsquo;d like to see an even longer list. If you have something to add, I recommend sending it in to the Reader (hypocriterdr@gmail.com) to be printed in next issue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Afterthoughts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy the way, there&rsquo;s now an (analog) HOCD zine in the works, and an associated <a href=\"http://byocd.tumblr.com\">blog</a>. <a href=\"http://byocd.tumblr.com/submit\">Contribute</a> to both!

You note the remarkable difference between love and other forms of consumption, but you do not explain it. The reason for this difference is that love is not a form of consumption at all but a form of production. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou observe that the effects of consumption are uniform while the effects of love are manifold. Manifold effects are just what we would expect from production\u2014where nothing becomes something, for there is a great variety of something\u2014and uniform effects are just what we would expect from consumption\u2014where something becomes nothing, for there is no variety in nothing. Love&rsquo;s effects are its products, and these products are not completely distinct from love itself. These products are products of a number of mostly uninteresting factors, chief among which is lovers&rsquo; complementary characters (i.e., what an endless number of online compatibility tests claim to disclose). Love is the process of production, involving both products and factors, but identical to neither of them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI think that your basic mistake is identifying love with one of its most salient phenomenal features, namely, the feeling of &ldquo;merging&rdquo; with someone. But this &ldquo;feeling of love&rdquo; is really just one of love&rsquo;s many effects. If it were the essence of love, it would also be love&rsquo;s sole effect, and then love would indeed be a form of consumption. For love&rsquo;s effects are not effects of this feeling; they are, like that feeling itself, effects of the complementary characters of lovers. If you could push a button and undergo a sensation of the appropriate phenomenal character towards an arbitrarily chosen person, you would not then be in love with him, since that sensation would not be causally related to him in the right way: you would have the feeling because you pushed a button and not because you were influenced by your acquaintance with him. There is no contradiction in supposing that you might feel the right way towards him without also wishing to talk or eat or work or play or live or sleep with him. In our ordinary experience the feeling of love invariably accompanies these other effects, but in fact there is no direct causal relationship subsisting between them; rather, they are all joint effects of a common cause. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nFor the last issue of the Hypocrite Reader I wrote two articles. Both were sincere, of course, but the first (<a href=\"/1/eat-the-person.html\">&ldquo;eat the person&rdquo;</a>) became increasingly unsatisfying to me after I wrote it, so I responded pseudonymously with <a href=\"/1/or-be-eaten.html\">&ldquo;...or be eaten.&rdquo;</a> The concerns in &ldquo;eat the person&rdquo; were abstract; the difficulties it suggested lovers face were totally unlike the hardest parts of relationships that I or my friends have known; its account of romance managed to overlook power, gender, pride, anger, weakness, fear, and failure. That&rsquo;s why my response drew upon <a href=\"http://muumuuhouse.com/mb.fiction2.html\">&ldquo;Clams,&rdquo;</a> which portrays those things so vividly that it kind of makes you want to die. Or anyway it made me want to die, and somehow I felt it would be valuable for other people to have the same experience.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhy, though? Why give such an apparently undesirable gift? I don&rsquo;t think I had a good answer for this question at the time the article was published. To motivate what I was doing, I talked about &ldquo;Clams&rdquo; in terms of a failure of ethics. I said that Nate was negligent and that &ldquo;eat the person&rdquo; lost sight of the other subjectivity; I said we can&rsquo;t dismiss and ignore the needs of the weak. I spoke to the Nates of the world and exhorted them to be better people. In short, I joined the discussion of the powerful. I channelled my feeling into a message for them, a plea that they make a sacrifice by bestowing their attention upon those more vulnerable. But hardly anyone fits easily into this category, &ldquo;the powerful.&rdquo; Letting my readers believe they belong first and foremost to such a category, addressing them on the other\u2019s behalf only, giving them a choice between their moral conscience and their own fulfilment -- all of these undermined my purpose. Anne&rsquo;s problems are universal.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is the Annes to whom I would rather speak -- that is, everyone, in their capacity as Anne. It\u2019s worthwhile to recall that we are not the experimenting subject described in &ldquo;eat the person,&rdquo; that we are not Nate. Forgetting this allows us to build an illusion of self-determination and disinterest that is hazardous individually and collectively. Individually, because it sets us up to fall apart like a house of cards the second the wind changes. Collectively, because it establishes an unrealizable norm and requires other Annes to build the same illusion. With this in mind, I have rewritten &ldquo;...or be eaten.&rdquo; It\u2019s below.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy the way, Megan Boyle has since written another story that I really like because it expresses some of the same range of emotions but shows how they can actually be part of a relationship that&rsquo;s working. It really made me feel a lot better about everything. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;How To Write &lsquo;How To Shit on LSD&rsquo;&rdquo; and you can read it <a href=\"http://thoughtcatalog.com/2011/how-to-write-how-to-shit-on-lsd/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"longhr\"/>\r\n\r\n<h1>...or be eaten</h1>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>&ldquo;Now she loves him and looks ahead with quiet confidence&mdash;like a cow.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Just glance at <a href=\"http://muumuuhouse.com/mb.fiction2.html\">&ldquo;Clams,&rdquo;</a> by Megan Boyle and see why the article <a href=\"/1/eat-the-person.html\">preceding this one</a> is ridiculous. Pick the first words that jump out from the page:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I feel really shitty right now. I feel like a piece of shit.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Everybody knows what that&rsquo;s like. Romance is not all sugar and sweetness. It&rsquo;s not all about trying to figure out what you want from the object you want. At least, not for everyone. That&rsquo;s the privilege of an autonomous subject interacting with static objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Clams&rdquo; is the story of some other kind of subject. To be specific, it&rsquo;s the story of two piece of shit characters who have the misfortune of meeting each other. The first piece of shit is a girl who wonders what everyone else&rsquo;s opinion is all the time, well in advance of figuring out her own. The other piece of shit is exactly the kind of boy the first piece of shit would be attracted to, an uncannily direct boy whose tactless honesty continually evokes her own shame for not knowing where the world ends and she begins. In the beginning of the story she&rsquo;s drunk enough to persuade him to dance and in her right mind enough to notice that kissing him makes her feel &ldquo;like she has swallowed a small, energetic frog.&rdquo; But after flying back home (1.5 days after meeting him) and getting into the habit of sending daily cross-country texts and emails, she completely loses her bearings:\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Anne has small superstitions which she uses to dispel anxieties. For instance, if she can make it to the fourth stain on the carpet by the time the elevator door closes, that means Nate has thought positively about her today, and there is a future where they know each other. It becomes a one-sided competition when a negative consequence is imagined: if she cannot touch two different kinds of tile with her feet by the time the toilet flushes, that means she said something crucially &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; in an email, and Nate will never contact her again. She doesn&rsquo;t keep track of which side is winning.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>There remains no vestige within her of the remotest possibility of determining what she wants from the object she wants&mdash;she&rsquo;s much too thoroughly caught up in determining whether it wants her. She notices that her feelings for it seem &ldquo;logically unjustifiable,&rdquo; but this information is not particularly relevant to her course of life. When they finally reunite and talk it is clear that she has sacrificed any personhood she may once have had in this asshole&rsquo;s name. When she can&rsquo;t even manage to make eye contact, he says,</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It seems like you really like me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anne feels exposed and vulnerable and desperately wants to convey the opposite, but knows that Nate will feel alienated if she is any way but honest. She wants to run into her closet and scream the word &ldquo;confidence.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I like you, I mean, sure, I. Don&rsquo;t you like me?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Yes, I like you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nate looks at Anne and moves his eyebrows together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It seems like it really matters what I think of you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Well. I think I worry about what everyone thinks of me. I think it matters what a lot of people think about me. It matters what you think about me, yeah.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nate exhales and looks in the opposite direction. Anne thinks he has looked in the opposite direction so he can roll his eyes at her without her knowing. She thinks of every word for &ldquo;god&rdquo; and &ldquo;shit&rdquo; she knows.</p>\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Of course she can&rsquo;t be direct with him the way he wants&mdash;that would entail confessing that, at that moment, he is the beginning and end of her speech. This boy has become the bearer of honesty and truth. That makes him someone she aspires to be and someone with the right to judge her, her greatest hope and her greatest shame. That&rsquo;s why her attachment escalated while he was far enough away to let her escape her immediate surroundings by inconsequentially hoping for him. That&rsquo;s why she saw in him the objective gaze that could determine the reality of her being, which she was unable or unwilling to do for herself. Now I&rsquo;d love to be some kind of Superfeminist and say that if women are inclined to be socially defined, so much the worse for autonomy and self-realization. But the trouble with handing someone else the right to interpret your reality is that there&rsquo;s a fair chance he might do it brutally.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>After they have sex that night, it is completely dark in Anne&rsquo;s apartment. Nate rolls over and doesn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What, what are you thinking right now,&rdquo; Anne says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was thinking... I don&rsquo;t have feelings for you, I don&rsquo;t feel emotionally attached to you, I just had sex with you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to say that I was unable to read this story taking it for what it was: the pitiful, everyday comedy that occurs when two shitballs collide. I&rsquo;m sorry to say that my heart followed the girlshit character the whole way through. The result of which was that by the end, I was in a rage. I hated Nate&rsquo;s guts. I hated the author&rsquo;s guts. How can this have happened? I kept asking. What happened? Anne&rsquo;s problems became my problems, and then the problems of women everywhere, and then the problems of all human beings who have ever encountered humiliation of any kind.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Anne drives for a long time, intermittently lighting cigarettes. She wants to have an interesting conversation with Nate. She considers several topics and decides that attempting conversation would show defeat in some way. She is strong. She does not need to talk. She wants Nate to know that she is having fascinating private thoughts that he could know if he asked her a question, any question. She directs the thought &ldquo;ask a question ask a question ask a question&rdquo; out of the right side of her head. It is too quiet. She needs to say something. Her throat tries to say something before her brain can think of something to say. She chokes a little, and swallows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really tired,&rdquo; she says.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>I guess &ldquo;Clams&rdquo; happens all the time. I guess if you wanted, you could probably just laugh it off. But humiliation like this&mdash;humiliation that knocks the personality right out of you, humiliation that makes you think you&rsquo;re nothing but a shit&mdash;it&rsquo;s not really humdrum, is it, and it&rsquo;s not really funny. I would even say that it fucking sucks. And it sucks that Anne is actually a smart person, someone who I bet could go on to write &ldquo;Clams,&rdquo; but this can happen to her anyway; it sucks that Nate is earnest and attentive, but he can be a cause of this anyway. If there&rsquo;s one thing romantic relationships teach us, it&rsquo;s that for all our made up problems in our carefully groomed lives, something can still be truly and definitively awful. We&rsquo;re vulnerable. All the more so when faced with the immense hope love provides: we&rsquo;ll give all we have to it, outside and in. Ironically enough, the resulting pain will just make us need a hug badly, so we&rsquo;ll keep coming back. But remember Anne, reader, when it happens again. It happened to Anne too. You are not a shit, not always. And you are not alone. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>",

            "rendered_content": "<blockquote> \u201cBelieving in progress does not mean believing that any progress has yet been made.\u201d \u2013 Franz Kafka\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the United States, there\u2019s a tendency to congratulate ourselves on becoming, or at least moving toward, a post-racial society. We have a sense that progress is the blurring of lines between racial identities. We can look back over the last century of our history and see the melting pot at work, merging together different European ethnicities, passing civil rights legislation, and slowly, slowly integrating parts of our society. Americans see this as the natural result of a progressive and modern society, where backwards traditions are gradually left behind. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRacial identity and ideology in Malaysia has had a very different trajectory. Malaysia has a majority ethnic Malay population, with a large Chinese minority and a smaller but still significant Indian population. The concept of race was introduced only with British colonization in the mid-nineteenth century, but today race is at the core of the country\u2019s society and politics. Instead of slowly fading away, the divisions between Malaysia\u2019s races have remained firmly entrenched in the nation\u2019s psyche, with most unaware that it\u2019s a relatively new phenomenon.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Malay Peninsula is arguably the most advantageous point for trading in Asia, and has long been a place for the exchange and mixing of cultures. Starting in the 13th century, the Chinese, Indians, and Arabs founded trading posts up and down the peninsula, and in the early sixteenth century Europeans arrived and founded trading posts as well. Early in the nineteenth century the British acquired the port city of Malacca from the Dutch, who had acquired it from the Portuguese. From Malacca and the British trading settlements on Penang and Singapore, British hegemony eventually spread over the whole southern part of the Malay Peninsula. The industries established by the British on the peninsula boomed, and the colonial authorities\u2019 hands-off immigration policy led to the arrival of hundreds of thousands of workers from other parts of the Malay Archipelago, southern China, and southeastern India. Most of the first wave of immigrants were men, many of whom assimilated into Malay culture and married native Malay women. <i>Peranakan</i>, which means \u201cnative-born\u201d in Malay, was the name given to the multi-racial peoples, usually Chinese-Malay, but also Indian-Malay and to some extent Euro-Malay. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe intermingling of different ethnic groups on the peninsula became problematic from the standpoint of the British Empire, so the British developed a census that divided the population of the Malay Peninsula into four racial categories: European, Malay, Chinese, and Indian. There was no category for <i>peranakan</i> or other multi-racial groups, and consequently the census forced them to choose which race they identified with. The census was central to the establishment of racial identity in Malaya, and, as the Malaysian historian Farish Noor puts it, \u201cafforded a sense of pseudo-scientific credibility to what was essentially a policy of divide and rule.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/4/ellis-ellis.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Ellis Calvin</i></center></p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe colonial authorities managed to divide the peninsula into separate economies segregated by race. The European racial ideology of the time established that race determined one\u2019s inherent behavior and potential. Not only would a segregated Malaya be easier to control, the British concluded, but each race could be put to work according to their abilities. Thus the Malays mostly worked in subsistence farming in rural villages (as they had done traditionally), the Indians lived and worked on British plantations, and the Chinese engaged in mining and small commercial agricultural enterprises. The British co-opted the Malay ruling class, making everyone from sultans to village headmen part of the colonial administrative structure and quickly replacing any defiant local authorities. The Chinese and Indians on the peninsula were kept in check mostly through their employers\u2014plantations, mining, and railroad companies that were either British-owned or Chinese-owned under British influence.  Each group had its own power structure, each ultimately under the control of the colonial authorities. The British had another motivation in segregating the division of labor: keeping wages low by suppressing collective action. An 1895 colonial journal advises employers on the peninsula, \r\n\t<blockquote>\r\n\tTo secure your independence, work with Javanese and Tamils and, if you have sufficient experience, also with Malays and Chinese; you can then always play the one against the other [\u2026] In case of a strike, you will never be left without labour, and the coolies of one nationality will think twice before they make their terms, if they know that you are in a position that you can do without them. \r\n\t</blockquote>\r\nBy ensuring the division of labor along racial lines, the colonial authorities were able to keep wages low and therefore maximize profits for the Empire.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNoor laments that \u201cPerhaps the most damaging feature of the colonial census was its capacity to erase and deny the legacy of cultural borrowing and cross-fertilization among [\u2026] the <i>peranakan</i> communities.\u201d Before the colonial census was established, Malays did not have the notion of a unified Malay identity; instead, they identified more strongly with their place of origin or with their allegiance to a particular local ruler than to the \u201cMalay nation.\u201d The early colonial censuses remained true to the self-identification of the Malay peoples: these censuses included subcategories under \u201cMalay race\u201d such as \u201cKrinchi\u201d and \u201cJambi,\u201d which are place names on Sumatra, not ethnicities. However, the arrival of Western racial theory forcibly united ethnic Malays, as it united Chinese and Indians, while pitting each group against each other. The ethno-nationalist United Malays National Organization (UMNO), founded in 1946, advocated for independence of the Malay Peninsula as an ethnic Malay nation. In the meantime, the colonial authorities were fighting a jungle war against the Malayan Communist Party (MCP), a group comprised mostly of ethnic Chinese. Although the MCP had led the insurgency against the Japanese occupation a decade earlier, the party (and to a certain extent the Chinese, by association) came to symbolize the greatest threat to the fledgling nation. UMNO formed the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition with the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) and Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), parties controlled in large part by Chinese and Indian business interests. The BN coalition has held power since independence in 1957.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRacial tensions escalated through the first years of independence until in 1969, a group of Chinese in Kuala Lumpur celebrating the results of a political election were attacked by a group of Malays and major rioting ensued. That the results of the 1969 federal election were at the core of the riots demonstrates the growing racial political divide. For their complicity in pro-Malay policies, the MCA and MIC lost support from their constituents, who handed big victories to the Democratic Action Party (a Chinese socialist party) and the Malaysian Islamic Party.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter being booted from UMNO for his criticism of then-Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman\u2019s handling of the 1969 race riots, a politician named Mahathir bin Mohammad set out to write down his thoughts on the racial dynamic of Malaysia. His book, <i>The Malay Dilemma</i>, is a wholly unscientific work of social Darwinism and racial stereotypes reminiscent of the British imperialist rhetoric of 70 years earlier. Mahathir takes for granted the idea that race determines not only appearance and culture, but inherent behavior and abilities as well. In the book he claims that millennia of famine and strife made the Chinese industrious and ambitious, while the Malays existed in a bountiful tropical paradise that made them lazy and complacent.  In two of the most alarming passages, he writes,\r\n\t<blockquote>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t[For the Malays] no great exertion or ingenuity was required to obtain food. There was plenty for everyone throughout the year. Hunger and starvation, a common feature in countries like China, were unknown in Malaya. Under these conditions everyone survived. Even the weakest and least diligent were able to live in comparative comfort, to marry and procreate. The observation that only the fittest would survive did not apply, for the abundance of food supported the existence of even the weakest.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t[\u2026]\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tFor the Chinese people, life was one continuous struggle for survival. In the process the weakest in mind and body lost out to the strong and resourceful. For generation after generation, for four thousand years, this weeding out of the unfit went on, aided and abetted by the consequent limitation of survival of the fit only. But, as if this was not enough to produce a hardy race, Chinese customs decreed that marriage should not be within the same clan, in direct contrast to the Malay partiality towards inbreeding.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t</blockquote>\r\nMahathir argues that unless the government provides special treatment for the Malays, they will eventually be wiped out by the Chinese. Despite initially being banned, the book became hugely popular and his proposals were eventually implemented by the same party that had previously expelled him. The New Economic Policy, as it\u2019s called, is possibly the most radical affirmative action program in the world. Malays were given large quotas at public universities and businesses, and even given discounts on real estate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMahathir, welcomed back into UMNO, served as prime minister for 22 years beginning in 1981. The New Economic Policy officially ended in 1990, but most of its measures remain in effect today. The numbers show that the program may have had some success in increasing equity between ethnic Malays and non-Malays, and especially in decreasing poverty rates, but it may also have inculcated a sense of racial entitlement and privilege among young Malays. The NEP policies have also further alienated the Chinese and Indian communities. Officially the government line is that Malaysia needs to break down its racial barriers\u2014the current prime minister launched a campaign called <a href=\"http://www.1malaysia.com.my/\">1Malaysia</a> whose goal is to unite the country into a <i>bangsa Malaysia</i>, or \u201cMalaysian race\u201d\u2014yet through policies like the NEP the BN ensures that it will not.<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIs this just a different form of racial progress, one which diverges from our American notion? In the same time period that the United States went from the end of slavery to a multi-racial president, Malaysia saw the introduction and imposition of racial ideology that became the premise of its national history. The trend since independence has been toward continuing or even deepening racial divisions, but it\u2019s important to note there are signs that the process may be reversing. The country\u2019s radical affirmative action policies are less and less popular, even with Malays. The internet, which enjoys more freedom than traditional media in Malaysia, has allowed criticism of race-based government policies. Although the 2008 general election returned the BN to power, non-racially affiliated opposition parties received nearly 47 percent of the vote and, for the second time in history, more than a third of seats in Parliament. These signs would seem to indicate that a universal idea of racial progress, one which involves the disassembling of racial barriers, may prevail after all. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\">\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nThese policies that reinforce racial divisions are also evident in the design of Malaysia\u2019s new capital city, Putrajaya, about which I\u2019ve written <a href=\"http://www.elliscalvin.com/projects/Calvin_BA_Final.pdf\">previously</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

            "rendered_content": "<p>One morning, several hours before dawn, I found my boots so stiff from the cold that I could not put them on. It was dark and snowflakes drifted down from the trees with each gust of wind and I took my boots away from the tent and pissed on them. The frozen leather steamed from the warmth of my urine and I pried open the tongue of each boot and thrust my feet inside.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe path twisted incomprehensibly through the trees and for a long time we fumbled through snowdrifts into the gaping darkness. As we passed a large frozen lake the first rays of sunlight settled on the tips of the peaks to the west and from there we headed east and then southeast over talus fields towards a steep snow chute curling up the western aspect of the mountain. Gusts of wind froze my face and fingers and my damp breath stiffened into a halo around my mouth. We moved steadily upwards, making our way in the shadow of the mountain, until we reached a place where the sun cast hard streaks of light over the ridgeline. There we stopped to warm ourselves upon a rock. We chewed on Cliff bars that we held in our armpits to keep them from freezing and we looked down at our deep footprints zigzagging up the sheer slope beneath us. \r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/3/claire-hannah.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Claire Bidwell</i></center></p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe climbed over mixed rock and snow, weaving in and out of the shadows beneath looming needles of red schist and granite. In the afternoon we stood upon a thin ledge with our chests pressed close to the smooth rock and decided that we could go no further. We turned around and soon we were gliding down the sticky wet snow while the sun beat warmly upon us. To the north, mounds of glassy-smooth ice swelled from the earth and glistened in the sunlight and we stopped beneath them to drink the last of our water.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs we arrived at camp our throats were dry and aching from the long day and a heavy greyness had settled over the woods. We melted snow for water until the stove sputtered from the altitude and went out. After drinking I sat inside the tent with my feet protruding from the vestibule and I removed my gaiters. Beneath, the laces were stiff and useless like old spaghetti and ice was clumped tightly between the tongue and my ankle. When I tried to take off the boot I discovered that the sock was frozen to the inside of it. I slid my foot out of the sock. My toes and heel were mottled white and purple, and they were stiff and waxy and without feeling.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Shit,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Looks I&rsquo;ve got frostbite.&rdquo; I showed it to my climbing partner.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;It might only be frostnip,&rdquo; he replied.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI removed the other boot and the other foot was the same.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I guess we won&rsquo;t be climbing tomorrow.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;No I guess not.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Well, we should probably hike out tonight if that&rsquo;s okay with you. I just want to see a doctor as soon as possible, you know.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine. We can leave tonight though if you want.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Yeah I&rsquo;d prefer that, I think.&rdquo; I laughed. &ldquo;I guess we got our adventure.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMy climbing partner took pictures of my feet and we packed our things and made jokes. I put on two pairs of socks and the thin rubber sandals that I used as camp shoes and I glided over the snowy trail with ease. I felt no cold and I felt no pain but I sang as I moved to keep the fear away. By now the sun had set and since the night was cloudy we walked with our headlamps on and kept our heads down to illuminate the trail beneath our feet. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAt last we reached the trailhead. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAs my climbing partner drove us to the emergency room I cradled my feet which were now thickly swollen and such an unnatural shade of purple that I did not want to look at them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter we reached the emergency room a nurse brought me a wheelchair and I sat down. She asked to see my feet and when I removed my socks she said, &ldquo;Oh my.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you ever seen frostbite before?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe nurse admitted that she had not.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen I changed into a hospital gown I began to shiver and the shivering did not stop until the nurse piled several heated blankets on top of me. I was dirty and my hair was full of grease and now that my clothes were gone I could smell myself. The nurse put an IV in my arm and I slept and when I woke I asked for water. After that the doctor came. He was tall and pale with dark hair and he seemed kind and serious. He touched my feet cautiously and asked me questions like, &ldquo;Can you feel this?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Close your eyes\u2026 now tell me, which toe am I touching?&rdquo; I could tell when he was touching my feet but I always guessed the wrong toe and sometimes I guessed the wrong foot. The doctor looked concerned but he would not say if I would lose my toes. He only took pictures of my feet with his iPhone and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s too early to tell. I&rsquo;m going to have the nurse rewarm your feet and meanwhile I&rsquo;ll send these pictures to a friend of mine. He&rsquo;s a burn specialist and he knows more about frostbite than I do. He should know what to do.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe nurse brought a pan of warm water and I put my feet into it. She said, &ldquo;I hope this is the right temperature. Tell me if it&rsquo;s too hot. The rewarming might be painful so just call me if you need anything.&rdquo; Then I was left sitting alone with my climbing partner. I told him I was afraid and he replied that probably it was not a big deal and after that we sat in silence. When the nurse returned she touched my feet and said, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a good temperature now.&rdquo; Although as far as I could tell nothing had changed. She dried my feet and placed strips of cotton between the toes to keep them from sticking together and then she wrapped my feet in bandages.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI told the nurse that I was afraid and she suggested that I call my parents. After three or four rings my mother picked up the phone, her voice low and hoarse from sleep. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Hi.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Hannah?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Yeah it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Hannah is everything okay?&rdquo;\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI paused for a long time before I spoke. I was trying not to cry. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I think I have frostbite and it could be really bad. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe was not angry but she was afraid and she would not stop talking. She talked for a long time and it was hard for me to interrupt her.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFinally I did. I said, &ldquo;Please please stop talking, you&rsquo;re upsetting me and I wish I hadn&rsquo;t called.&rdquo; I did not cry but my throat felt tight and I was shaking.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHer voice got flat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry Hannah. I love you and I only want to help.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I love you too. I&rsquo;m sorry too.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Can I talk to the doctor?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Yeah, but please don&rsquo;t be too hard on him.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, Hannah.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI slept again and when I woke two paramedics had arrived to transport me to a different hospital. I asked to use the bathroom. They told me that I was not allowed to walk anymore and then they gave me a bedpan and left the room. I did not know how to use the bedpan and I spilled warm urine on myself and on the sheets and by the time the paramedics returned it was cold and sticky. They gave me a new gown but they did not change the sheets. I had to avoid that side of the bed until they moved me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThey dropped me off at the other hospital and a nurse brought me a fruit cup but I did not eat. She took my vital signs and said things like, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been through a lot today&rdquo; and &ldquo;You must be so scared.&rdquo; I was too tired to be scared and I only wanted to sleep but she stood by my bed and looked at me until I cried and then she held my hand.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI woke up very hungry the next morning. I called room service and ordered cream of wheat with brown sugar and an English muffin with butter and jam. I was not allowed to drink coffee because it might impede the blood flow to my toes so I asked for orange juice instead. When the food arrived I ate quickly and scraped my bowl clean. After that I watched television as I waited for the doctor to come. My feet were still bandaged so I could not look at them. The nurse came by every hour or so to check my vital signs and she would ask how bad the pain was and if I wanted oxycodone. When I told her that I had no pain she did not believe me. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to be brave,&rdquo; she said.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDr. B. came to see me in the afternoon. She entered the room briskly and without any warning she unwrapped my feet. I averted my eyes but then I had to look. The toes were still purple-grey and swollen as they had been the night before but now a few clear blisters had formed on them. I asked the doctor how bad it was. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely serious,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not the worst I&rsquo;ve ever seen.&rdquo; My toes had not yet turned black so there was a good chance I would keep them but it was too early to say for sure.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLater that day they moved me to the burn facility and shortly after that my father arrived. He had flown all the way from DC and he looked thinner than usual and his eyes were red and watery. He was wearing a yellow hairnet and blue gloves and he had a disposable apron covering his clothes. When I saw him I started to cry. He cried also and sat on the edge of my bed and hugged me for a long time. Then he hugged me again and said, &ldquo;This one is from your mother. You know she loves you so much and she just wants you to get better.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe next morning my toes were covered with blisters. The toes themselves were still dull purple but the blisters were tight and swollen and they gleamed under the fluorescent lights. Sometimes my leg would twitch and the blisters would spurt cold, sticky fluid and the loose skin would settle over the toe like a wrinkled blanket.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDr. G. stuck his head into my room one afternoon. He did not come all the way inside because to do so he would have had to put on a gown and gloves.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Just wanted to check in and see how the toes are coming along.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nHe had been a military doctor for many years and had seen plenty of frostbite cases. He spoke softly and with a slight drawl and he did not make eye contact when he spoke.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;They&rsquo;re fine. I have a lot of blisters.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Well you know the blisters are a good thing, they&rsquo;re just part of the healing process. Any pain?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;No.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t be afraid when you start to feel it. The pain is a good sign.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;I know. I&rsquo;m looking forward to it. Do you think I&rsquo;m going to lose the toes?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say but I think they&rsquo;re looking good. We just have to wait and see. Do you know how the saying goes?&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n&ldquo;No.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&ldquo;Freeze in January, amputate in July.&rdquo; The doctor chuckled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only March, you know.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a while the doctors stopped coming to see me because there was nothing to be done except to keep my feet clean and avoid infection. That could be left to the nurses. The nurses were kind and friendly and they were impressed with my blisters and told me gruesome stories about other patients. I curled my toes to get the circulation going and I ate spicy foods because I was told that it might help. Some of the smaller toes began to show signs of pink beneath the wrinkled dead skin and the nurses congratulated me on this development. But the big toes were still dark and blistered and I had no feeling in any of them. Also the tip of one toe had become black and hard and it was beginning to shrivel. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\n\r\nThe title for this piece comes from Natasha Bershadsky&rsquo;s story,  &ldquo;<a href=\" https://sites.google.com/site/birdshadowsky/capture-alive/home\">Capture Alive</a>.&rdquo; Wandering around Kyoto, the narrator, Senia, thinks,\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nHey, maybe what I wanted all along with my women amounts to a basic principle of Japanese garden design. &ldquo;Capture alive.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s something beyond a garden&rsquo;s boundary \u2013 a waterfall, a hill. One constructs the garden to lure it inside. You plant a few cryptomerias in the right spots, put up a little fence to conceal a factory in the mid-distance, and, bang! the far-away ridges are trapped.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nRemembering a love letter from his elusive lover prompts the association. But the idea, &ldquo;capture alive,&rdquo; applies to more than just his pursuit of Antoaneta. Senia spends his time in Kyoto wandering formlessly through his memories, which have a mind of their own: they appear when he doesn&rsquo;t seek them and they fade when he tries to envision them. The story ends with a Calvino quote that shows his groundlessness in relation to himself: &ldquo;And the desires&mdash;&lsquo;in the shape of Los Angeles, in the shape of Kyoto-Osaka, without shape...&rsquo;&rdquo; Like his activities with women, his acts of self-interpretation attempt to take in something uncultivated, to make it more his own.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA person&rsquo;s own being is obviously not simple to capture and bring into harmony with a design. We risk taking the life out of the object. Or else we risk capturing it inadequately, leaving some piece both unincorporated and unreduced&mdash;an eyesore that threatens to break the illusion. Or finally, even if we make sure to incorporate as much as we can see, we risk being led to a design that won&rsquo;t suit our purposes&mdash;a coherent territory but of weeds and brambles. We can&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t be impartial when we interpret ourselves. We all want to be(come) someone. And the extensive material that faces us, though it provides no analysis on its own, is teeming and reactive.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Part One: Apart From the World</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAn old friend of mine, Aaron Shelhamer, makes a good case study in self-interpretation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSome time ago Aaron stopped believing in free will. Back then, I argued that he shouldn&rsquo;t be sad about the loss. I had a theory to prove this, one that located freedom somewhere other than in uncaused behavior, but he didn&rsquo;t buy it; he was still disappointed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSeveral years and several thoughts later, I wrote him again to ask about what happened. Developing a universal theory of freedom was no longer my project, or anyway, I didn&rsquo;t think I could approach the question directly and in isolation. Instead, I wanted to think about how theories of freedom interact with the lives of people who hold those theories. Do they capture those lives in rich detail, do they bring color to life experiences, do they effect any lifestyle changes? This was his response (boldface mine):\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThe reason the thought of myself not having free will makes me sad is because it would make me less than what I had imagined myself as being when I was younger. Now the shattering of adolescent preconceptions is nothing new to me, but what makes this one so important is that it is about <b>what makes me &ldquo;me&rdquo;</b>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nBefore I had a certain mental categorization of myself and of humans in general as <b>different from all other animals</b> in quality of mental faculties and also a very definite <b>separation between the animate and inanimate</b>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf free will doesn&rsquo;t exist that categorization becomes nearly meaningless. In my mind what was &ldquo;me&ldquo; was <b>not just</b> my physical body + the forces acting upon and within me; there was all of that <b>plus something else</b>. That <b>tiny bit</b> of free will. Something separate from what makes up a brick or a dog. Something akin to a soul. A more spiritual person might call it a soul or &ldquo;a <b>spark</b> of the divine.&rdquo; Something borderline supernatural (actually for many, supernatural is exactly what it would be). I am not a believer in the supernatural; I do not believe in god, ghosts, angels, santa claus, the tooth fairy, or trickle down economics. I pride myself in being grounded in reality. That concept of free will gave me this feeling of having <b>a special place in the universe</b>. A feeling that as a unique human being I was <b>not just</b> a cog in a machine, but rather it was almost if there was a piece of me that was apart from the world. That this soul-like attribute of consciousness was <b>a universe unto itself</b>. That there was some sort of <b>metaphysical wall from behind which my thoughts could extend into this world, but which no physical effect of this universe could reach back and molest</b>. A &ldquo;me&rdquo; that was <b>apart and unchangeable</b> that worked in concert with my physical body and all the physical forces that we experience outside and in.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nInstead I now find the concept I have for &ldquo;me&rdquo; is not the same sort of unique. now it is <b>the same kind of unique that a stone on a river bed might be unique and pretty, but not really different than any other pretty rock that&rsquo;s ever existed</b>. I think when I became an atheist I had neglected to reintegrate the concept of free will and <b>what makes me &ldquo;me&rdquo;</b> with my new found relationship with reality. I had built up so many experiences since then based upon my old view of self that when I was confronted with my friend&rsquo;s argument that free will could not exist I felt myself having a mental crisis of sorts. I simultaneously felt that the straight forward nature of his logic, and that his arguments were all based upon things that I also believed to be true <b>made it seem undeniable yet it seemed so abhorrent, so contrary to the arrogance and narcissism</b> that I viewed the world and my personal relationship with it that I couldn&rsquo;t make myself believe what I knew had to be true. It&rsquo;s almost as if I prevented myself from totally realizing how true I knew it had to be, based upon my other beliefs, because it was too much to bear.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt now makes me think of how people used to believe the earth was the center of the universe despite what they could observe because they couldn&rsquo;t bear the thought of how the universe just might not give a shit what they did on their crappy planet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis new view does give me a good excuse though. &ldquo;The thought of having no free will makes me sad because I have no free will and thus am <b>forced to feel sad</b>, and <b>that&rsquo;s just the way things are</b> no matter how much I would like them to be different&rdquo; :)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/3/tom-cat.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Tom Tian</i></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>That Secret Something</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA &ldquo;tiny spark,&rdquo; a suddenly appearing and just as suddenly vanishing light&mdash;something that hints it could be dazzling and overwhelming, but something that&rsquo;s easy to miss. Something that in its tininess and transience must make itself shown to you and you alone. You take it to a safe place (&ldquo;a metaphysical wall from behind which my thoughts could extend into this world, but which no physical effect of this universe could reach back and molest&rdquo;) where the world won&rsquo;t step all over it and there you let it glow. Your word &ldquo;spark&rdquo; suggests visibility, but tinyness, barely-thereness, vulnerability&mdash;it lets us wonder about the something&rsquo;s relationship to other people and their gaze. Is that gaze too clumsy to see something so naturally rare and fleeting, or does the spark sense a danger in being seen all too clearly? Doesn&rsquo;t it seem to hide? Maybe other people are a threat to it; maybe they can demonstrate that it doesn&rsquo;t count for anything; maybe they see something else on you instead. In any case, the spark becomes your special friend; you protect it and hold it in its smallness, and in turn it&rsquo;s always there for you; as you say, the thing that really makes you &ldquo;you.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe can consider what it&rsquo;s like to keep a secret. On the one hand, you miss opportunities to let other people talk to that part of you; you might build an anxiety around letting them in; you might feel a greater rift between you and them the longer you keep your secret inside; the secret&rsquo;s importance might intensify while it&rsquo;s bottled up, since it represents that rift. On the other hand, if you let them, other people may not handle the secret with the delicacy it deserves; they may not understand. Keeping a secret from the world can give you the space you need to come into relation to your secret, to let the secret grow into its meaning.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI am not saying that you kept secret the fact of having free will. But your &ldquo;tiny spark&rdquo; metaphor suggests a relationship with free will that is primarily private and intimate. A friendship so private, so apart, can refuse the insistences of the world and especially the threats of the world, and in so doing it can let you believe in your own potential and give space for this potential&rsquo;s gradual growth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>That Certain Something</h3>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou know that either all humans have this something, or none do. Viewing yourself through the lens of this something makes you a representative of humanity as a whole; your particularity is abstracted away. When you stop believing in your own free will, you unearth a tragedy for everyone. But if anyone has it, it&rsquo;s yours and yours to keep, no matter how you might talk or feel or make decisions on a day-to-day basis.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPersonal anxieties that might distinguish you from other people&mdash;anxieties given to you by your own circumstances, your own history, your peculiar relationships and peculiar choices&mdash;don&rsquo;t come into consideration when you ask, &ldquo;Do I have free will?&rdquo; You might as well ask, &ldquo;Do humans have free will?&rdquo; And if they do, then no matter how bad your appearance, behavior, or job prospects, you have this other something through everything and can always fall back on it. Likewise, if they don&rsquo;t, it is not you and your particularities alone which have failed. You don&rsquo;t risk intense personal shame by investing in free will. You especially don&rsquo;t risk having to think about your ranking with respect to other people.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this way, setting up the hierarchy &ldquo;free will/not free will&rdquo; can be a way of building walls to block from view things about yourself and your experience which another interpretive lens might have captured. You are left with a walled-in space &ldquo;which no physical effect of this universe could reach [\u2026] and molest.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo call inhabiting such a space &ldquo;escapism&rdquo; or &ldquo;avoidance,&rdquo; however, may not be fair. The full scorn of those words should not apply to every instance in which someone ignores an aspect of the world. There are a vast number of good reasons to turn your attention away from particular things: they may be distracting if you&rsquo;re trying to do something, they may leave you stuck playing a role, they may cripple you with self-doubt, or in any other way their visibility might make another thing harder to see. To see clearly is not to see unselectively; often things must be seen &ldquo;past&rdquo; or seen &ldquo;through&rdquo; in order to find what you&rsquo;re looking for and do what you want with it. The words &ldquo;escapism&rdquo; and &ldquo;avoidance&rdquo; suggest that if you faced your issues, you could deal with them and move forward in life, whereas in the place you escape to your life &ldquo;goes nowhere&rdquo; and just plays your dreams on repeat. Neither assumption need be true.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>That Special Something</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough you don&rsquo;t take the risk of aspiring to rank higher than other people, there do exist entities you feel attached to being qualitatively different from, categorically better than, absolutely above. It cannot be a matter of degree; it must be indisputable.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat entities are these? &ldquo;Animals&rdquo; on the one hand, &ldquo;the inanimate&rdquo; on the other. These two inferior groups are very different from each other&mdash;are they nonetheless interchangeable in the economy of self-evaluation? Is the only point to be part of a superior species?\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough this is an important thing that they both do, each choice undoubtedly calls different aspects of yourself to light. To be other than an animal calls to mind language, and reflection, and that eternal metaphysical realm (&ldquo;apart and unchangeable&rdquo;) where you feel safe, where your thoughts are unmolested. To be animate is the point from which your physical capabilities begin&mdash;movement on your own and the mysterious inner spark that propels such a movement.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>That Extra Something</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou seek your essence in the unaccounted for. You aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;just&rdquo; a body plus some forces upon it. You have something that has been stripped of identifying characteristics, something invested with the magic of being unnamed.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe might suspect the negative nature of this conception. It persists beyond any limitations the world might like to set upon it; it squirms away from concrete formulation. We know from our earlier discussion not to say that you&rsquo;re being &ldquo;escapist,&rdquo; but isn&rsquo;t it somehow a problem to have a view of yourself that&rsquo;s unverifiable? Isn&rsquo;t it suspicious that you can&rsquo;t be held accountable? I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with this. In everyone there are qualities that as of yet are unformed and need space for experimentation. And there are pieces in us that don&rsquo;t belong among the words we have invented. And finally, let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves&mdash;there is magic.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Beauty as Consolation Prize</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat is left once free will is gone? You become a rock, a mere object; you become &ldquo;objectified.&rdquo; When you&rsquo;re no longer a subject with a gleaming interiority, with secretiveness, with restrained potential, the only access to yourself is from outside yourself. You become part of the world, whether you like it or not. Hence the new question, if you wish to have any ground on which to continue loving yourself&mdash;how do you look?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne way to interpret this change is to say that before it happened, you escaped your life and replaced it with &ldquo;a universe unto itself,&rdquo; but after it happened, you had no choice but to make a universe out of your life. Indeed, with the onset of this question, &ldquo;how do you look?&rdquo;, your being shows itself as full of details, often trapping details. How you spend your hours, the myriad ways in which you feel and move and think, the ways you are caught in a web of activities and of relationships with other people, your physical body&mdash;all of these can present themselves to you as possibilities for an artwork you must make of yourself. Any of them might cohere into an aesthetic object. That you will see this object as a thing of beauty (and not, for example, ugliness) is by no means a given. To become beautiful to yourself is a feat. It&rsquo;s a feat of reappropriation; what you ran from before (we might say), now you must learn to embrace.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo appropriate the repulsive details of your life and nature&mdash;that can be a wonderful thing. Where there was once a schism, you may learn to have compassion for your various places and moments. You may attend to little things that always persisted but were persistently ignored; you may bring your heart into the food you cook, the things you say to your siblings, your choice of temporary jobs. So we might say that you&rsquo;ll see yourself more the way a reader like myself might see you&mdash;someone whose mind&rsquo;s activity is part of an entire textured existence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHowever, we must be sure that our ideas of what counts as &ldquo;world&rdquo; and &ldquo;life&rdquo; and &ldquo;nature&rdquo; are not limiting. While it&rsquo;s clear that with this change, some details will be newly incorporated into your sense of self, it&rsquo;s not clear that no details will be lost. Calling yourself beautiful like &ldquo;a pretty rock on a riverbed&rdquo; already suggests what slice of life you might choose&mdash;a passive one, not a powerful one; one that is static and unchanging. Your attention will privilege affective states over aspirational principles; you will notice that you are full of pleasure sooner than full of the potential to fulfil a project. Your rosy-colored glasses will bring monotony and leveling; prioritization and hierarchization will be less available to you. You will no longer be &ldquo;unique.&rdquo; You will be unlikely to brush off the mundane and stifling in favor of a goal because all possible goals will have less value for you; they are only a little rock&rsquo;s goals, only the goals of a pretty object. You will be unlikely to take any hope of yours with the weightiest seriousness; it is unlikely that you will allow yourself to be seized with frenzy. No wonder, then, that beauty is merely a consolation prize, a silver lining on the cloud of that extra something&rsquo;s absence.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Forced Alternatives</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile as a reader I see each of your alternatives&mdash;having free will, or having a rock&rsquo;s beauty&mdash;as full conceptions of ways of being which are structured by non-obvious metaphors, it is clear that you see them as the only two available alternatives. Either you have this incredible something, or you follow the logic of an apparently straightforward outlook&mdash;which tells you that you are no different from a rock, which tells you that you are stuck. If you are sad, you are &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to be sad.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBoth before and after your conversion, you made a complete world out of an interesting and worthwhile slice of yourself. The vitality of these worlds can be seen by the fullness of your descriptions, your rich use of metaphors. These metaphors are simultaneously prohibitive and empowering. Unfortunately, your impression that the metaphors are not your own, but are merely consequences of a right or wrong idea, increases their prohibitive intensity. You miss the fact that more is available to you than these two possibilities of relating to yourself, that a multitude of different gardens might be constructed.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Part Two: Ambition</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThough she doesn&rsquo;t submit to an &ldquo;objective&rdquo; interpretation, our second case subject doesn&rsquo;t seem to have it easy. Once we recognize the plurality of ways we could see ourselves, will self-interpretation become uncomplicated? A host of issues linger, or appear for the first time. What do we look for in ourselves, and what do we hope to find there? What kind of garden do we want to be, and what do we do if that garden seems impossible to build?\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nIf only I were sharper, quicker on my feet. The world is very compelling to someone who can&rsquo;t formulate arguments against it; you just have to go along with it. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve always just been a follower&mdash;one person&rsquo;s follower, then another&rsquo;s.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf only my energy level were up all the time. As it is drowsiness is always overtaking me. And then I can&rsquo;t engage people. They can say things to me, or I can say things to them, but it never comes to anything; we never really talk.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf only my hair weren&rsquo;t so frizzy and messy, like someone not even presentable, like a homeless person. If it were straight and smooth, I would have the confidence to look people in the eye and to speak to them directly. I&rsquo;m fine with looking like a tomboy, but I want to look like a fun, sunny tomboy, somebody you&rsquo;d want to play ball with or something.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf only my speed were exactly right&mdash;slow and graceful enough to absorb, to think, to speak with reason; but not sluggish. Feet apart, mind ready. Then I would catch the moments as they went by and throw something back into them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf only I had willpower. I try the lighter with my little resolutions and there are sparks sometimes but never a steady flame. I&rsquo;m not a resolute person. I&rsquo;m just a person hoping for a miracle.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf only I were born in the slums and arrested for armed robbery. In my jail cell there would be no distractions and nothing to stop me from rising above my station. I would memorize the dictionary line by line. After that I would be very intelligent, and I would make a list of all the things I should write treatises on. Then I would go down the list and write all of them one by one.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf only my house were cleaner and fresher and calmer and more exotic, like a Japanese tea room. Then I could sit down and inhale the air and feel ready to do anything.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThis passage comes from a friend&rsquo;s meditations about an episode of her past. Note just a few things:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Stuckness</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nIf only you could be removed&mdash;removed to a jail cell, removed to someplace calm and exotic. If only you were &ldquo;slow&rdquo; enough that you could remove yourself, and not always only follow, not always go along with the world that keeps compelling you forward. But at the same time, if only you could have the energy and speed and vivacity to participate; if only you could really interact with people, and burn as a flame, and catch and throw the ball. You admire an intensely active realm; you would like to be removed from the sticky, rolling morass you&rsquo;re in so that you can take the time to inhale and ready yourself to enter that realm.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou know two realms&mdash;one a miserable and dreary swamp, the other forbiddingly alive. Emerging from the former into the latter seems nearly impossible.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Substitution</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf only you could have any one of the things you wished for, it could allow you to develop a higher form of being. Here beauty (smooth hair) is not a consolation prize but a magical power. Though somebody could see many of the things you wish for as small, insignificant changes, for you they take on an intense life. They are substitutes for a deep and important thing, keys to the active realm.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/bigsley\">@bigsley&rsquo;s</a> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/bigsley/status/40944364385603584\">tweet</a> of 2/24/11 expresses the bizarreness of this kind of substitution: &ldquo;one cannot actually lose one&rsquo;s humanity. there is no &lsquo;smarter&rsquo; or &lsquo;dumber&rsquo; or &lsquo;realer&rsquo; or &lsquo;faker&rsquo; or &lsquo;skinnier&rsquo; or &lsquo;fatter&rsquo; to become.&rdquo; The surprise of this comes through especially in its denying the existence of &ldquo;skinnier&rdquo; and &ldquo;fatter,&rdquo; obvious, concrete qualities. But they don&rsquo;t exist, the logic goes, in their primary role in your consciousness: as qualities that bestow or take away humanity. It&rsquo;s strange that when you strive for something fundamentally important, for the quality of being somebody, of being human, you can identify that humanity with any number of characteristics, each of which seems to express it completely. Each one, in the moment you envision it, is both necessary and sufficient to grant you a better life. But each one is something you don&rsquo;t have.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Validity/Invalidity</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf only you and your acquaintances could ever &ldquo;actually talk.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s an odd thing to say&mdash;you never talk to people? Of course you do in the usual sense of the word, but you have a high ideal for what counts as talking, a vision of something precious, and what actually happens doesn&rsquo;t match up.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou take an ordinary word like &ldquo;talking&rdquo; and invest it with a meaning that makes it hard for you to do that very ordinary thing. The result&mdash;&ldquo;we never really talk,&rdquo; or (we could imagine) &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really living,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really myself&rdquo;&mdash;is to state very aggressively that nothing is happening; that whatever happens doesn&rsquo;t even qualify as something.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTalking/not talking is just one of your several binaries that draw a wedge between being and nonbeing. You&rsquo;re a &ldquo;follower&rdquo; who only ever &ldquo;goes along with the world&rdquo;; you never grapple with it as a subject. And because you don&rsquo;t have a speed that&rsquo;s &ldquo;exactly right,&rdquo; your moments just pass you by, and you don&rsquo;t get to participate in your own life. You participate on the side of nonbeing; you inhabit a space that you violently discount. This means that you don&rsquo;t get to talk; you don&rsquo;t get to experience moments; your existence is invalid; your life is not even anything.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Rumination vs. Reflection</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf only there were a healthy, nonviolent way to criticize yourself and reject some aspect of your life. Oh, but isn&rsquo;t there? Emphatically, YES. Consider the following gchat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<b>person1</b>: i got up at noon today<br>\r\n<b>person1</b>: i mean first i woke up earlier, but i had an erection and was avoiding walking into the living room to get my pants<br>\r\n\r\n<b>person2</b>:  hehe<br>\r\n<b>person1</b>: so i just laid in bed waiting for my erection to go away, but it wouldn&rsquo;t go away<br>\r\n<b>person1</b>: of course i didn&rsquo;t realize that&rsquo;s why i was staying in bed until after the fact<br>\r\n<b>person1</b>: (or i would have braved it)<br>\r\n<b>person2</b>: hindsight unhelpful as always lol<br>\r\n\r\n<b>person1</b>: yeah\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPerson1 could think &ldquo;if only I were the sort of person ever to stand back and look at my experience, a person capable of giving himself the law instead of just reacting, then I could get out of bed in the mornings.&rdquo; But we have no reason to think he will mull over this failure and treat it as general. He learns from his experience and next time, he&rsquo;ll remember and act differently.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Seizing Your Self-Interpretation</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou don&rsquo;t seem to wield your self-interpretation in the interest of carefully considered ends. The garden you imagine is a worthy one, but you haven&rsquo;t begun to capture it; it&rsquo;s not within view; you&rsquo;re surrounded by desert. The question is how to move forward rather than standing still.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI wouldn&rsquo;t suggest you give up on your ambitions. But it may help to establish goals that are specific, rigorously defined, and achievable from the place you currently stand. If you do that, then you can begin to ground your projects of self-respect in their successes rather than their failures. And though it may sound petty to a person so ambitious, I would suggest happiness as one thing to treat as a success and a reward. I think a lot can be learned from restructuring one&rsquo;s life as an anti-depression project.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Part Three: Capturing Ksenia</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFinally we come back to Senia, Bershadsky&rsquo;s narrator. Our third act of self-interpretation will at first seem more like an act of other-interpretation, since the greater part of Senia&rsquo;s thoughts in Kyoto concern his ex-wife, Ksenia.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Details</h3>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nKsenia got into birds during her first year in the States. There was a parakeet colony in front of our windows in Hyde Park. Shrieking in the snow. Their nests suggesting feral sweaters caught in the trees. She more or less hibernated till the end of March, then woke up and started to chirrup. She sat in on some advanced Italian class, and also began disappearing twice a week at 7 AM with a birding group. She experimented with the form and content of ravioli. She resented her name being spelled with x, so she was constantly engaged in mock-desperate battles with various services over the phone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to spell it for you. Khh, like kingfisher, s like sparrow. No \u2013 sparrow! Sparrow, like swallow. Like starling! E like emu\u2026&rdquo; She loved lists of things and the vague narrative possibilities they entailed. She came across a frequency dictionary of English and conceived of reading it from cover to cover, preferably to me aloud. &ldquo;Years before between country,&rdquo; she shouted from the kitchen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give this title to my memoirs.&rdquo;\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nI asked the author why, though I liked Ksenia a great deal, I had the impression that she was somehow not much, a small person, someone in need of a project. Natasha reminded me that we only see Ksenia through the eyes of her husband. For this reason, she told me, it made sense that Ksenia would come across as having no direction.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis aspect of Senia&rsquo;s view of Ksenia comes across more obviously if we read on in the story:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nHer bird-watching activities always seemed to me alarmingly autistic. I don&rsquo;t know why I was so bothered that she never managed to identify with certainty anything apart from robins and cardinals. Even at those she would look protractedly, statically. When she was seeing something very interesting \u2013 a nuthatch or a wren \u2013 she would become even more hermetic. When I asked what was up, she would smile and keep staring. She never described what she saw. I also soon discovered that I was better than her at spotting. I wondered whether her birding was a pretext to be passive and indistinct.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHere Senia self-consciously looks down on his wife. The first block quote above shows his condescension more subtly. Ksenia is seen behaving like an animal (hibernating, chirruping), performing a domestic task (ravioli), delighting in a pleasant arbitrary thing (the frequency dictionary), fussing lightly over a small matter (the spelling of her name), and picking up a number of hobbies. Seen doing all these things right in a row, she reminds me of my own analysis of Aaron&rsquo;s beautiful pebble: her activities look leveled, homogenous in their importance, nothing taking priority. She looks like a woman who is full of details.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A Curious Absence</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe might ask how Senia views himself in order to look at Ksenia this way. He must be directed, purposeful, profound. But if so, this side of him shows up surprisingly little in the story. He mentions &ldquo;fostering an absurd suggestion that I have a professional interest in&rdquo; Japanese gardens, but not much else.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMore clearly, he is intensely sexual. Everywhere he thinks of sex: looking out the window in airplanes, watching birds, comparing cities. He cheats on Ksenia serially and keeps his mind on his mistresses. While not directed toward any purpose, not serving the interest of anything longterm, his sexual drive has nonetheless the structure of purposefulness: capture for the sake of capture.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>K/senia</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Here wigeons have rust-colored heads,&rdquo; the story begins, &ldquo;though now it&rsquo;s irrelevant.&rdquo; While they were married, each of his mistresses reminded him of one of Ksenia&rsquo;s birds. Now, a year after their divorce, Senia is still birdwatching absentmindedly. He spends his days in Kyoto waiting&mdash;his girlfriend Antoaneta is in a conference&mdash;and while waiting he thinks of Ksenia. Probably because &ldquo;her placidity rhymes with the mood of the gardens in which I loiter.&rdquo; His observations sound like things Ksenia would say, her lists, her word games: &ldquo;Unaffiliated white dots spin to the ground like sparrows or afterthoughts.&rdquo;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nWe have said that Senia&rsquo;s thoughts about Ksenia are not just an other-interpretation but indeed a self-interpretation. Ksenia represents a period in Senia&rsquo;s life. But more than that&mdash;she represents a mode of his life, or several modes. She embodies the domestic modes, and the modes of watching, the modes of waiting. And because so much of life exists in these modes, it seems fair to say that Ksenia is a part of Senia. That which he rejects as belonging to him, he reincorporates by imagining as hers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>The Limits of Interpretation</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nKsenia&rsquo;s ability to assert her presence as a live being should be taken as good news against misogyny. Senia&rsquo;s view of Ksenia can be seen as demeaning but remains gentle and at times admiring&mdash;because Ksenia is a real being outside him, because he cannot help but let her make her mark upon his mind. Likewise life&rsquo;s long moments of waiting and its irreducible details will refuse to be ignored.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nOf course, interpretation and life aren&rsquo;t perfect enemies. Hence the &ldquo;alive&rdquo; in &ldquo;capture alive.&rdquo; The subtlest task and the highest prize is to find a view that suits life and suits you at the same time.\r\n <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nIn Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s 1957 novel <i>Pnin</i>, the title character, given a rare chance to pass judgment on his author, says of Nabokov: \u201cI\u2019ve always had the impression that his entomology was merely a pose.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBetween 1941 and 1948, as unofficial curator of the butterfly collection at Harvard, Nabokov painstakingly reorganized the specimens there to meet his own meticulous standards of elegance and order. While puttering around the Museum of Comparative Zoology, he developed a hypothesis of the migration of the <i>Polyommatus</i> blues, a genus of small blue butterflies with spotted wings. Noting great physical diversity within the genus and even within its individual species, Nabokov theorized that the Blues had migrated in five waves from Asia to the Americas during prehistoric times, giving rise to five genetically distinct lineages. Among his novel claims were that the migration occurred across an ancient land bridge over the Bering Strait and that the \u201cKarner Blue\u201d was its own species, rather than a subspecies of \u201cMelissa Blues.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/3/mehves-sophie.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Mehve\u015f Konuk</i></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe perceived audacity of these ideas, coming from a man with no formal scientific background, was redoubled by Nabokov\u2019s unconventional approach to science writing: in a 1945 article for the entomological journal <i>Psyche</i>, he argued for his Bering Strait migration hypothesis by saying he \u201c[found] it easier\" to \"give a friendly little push to some of the forms [of Blues] and hang my distributional horseshoes on the nail of Nome\u201d rather than entertain the widely-accepted Pacific-crossing hypothesis.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nApparently, Nabokov\u2019s \u201cfriendly little push\u201d was not enough to convince his peers, and the theory received little support during his lifetime. When, years after his death, Karner Blue DNA was first sequenced in 1998, genetic evidence didn\u2019t seem to support his theory, either. One couldn\u2019t be blamed for thinking that perhaps Nabokov should have stuck to literature after all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf \u201cNabokov the naturalist\u201d was a pose, Nabokov the prose stylist was a natural. His seventeen novels, written in immaculate Russian (the first nine) and then English (the last eight), attest to a supreme mastery of literary gesture. Erudite, verbally exacting, and chock-full of puns, puzzles, and allusions, the novels suggest an uncommon degree of authorial control and intention. If one thing seems constant in Nabokov\u2019s \u0153uvre, it is <i>command</i>: command of languages and language, command over plot, and commanding imposition of a refined, almost rhadamanthine aesthetic. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe glaring exception is Nabokov\u2019s unfinished last novel\u2014his eighteenth, <i>The Original of Laura</i>. The novel describes Philip Wild, a \u201ccomically fat\u201d neurologist who is obsessed with the idea of erasing himself. Wild experiments with trance states and pills, trying desperately to shed material existence through the power of his mind. Readers never learn whether he succeeds: the text ends abruptly and vaguely, in its own version of the \u201c<i>envahissement</i> of delicious dissolution\u201d so longed-for by Wild\u2014Nabokov\u2019s notes simply peter out. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe working title of the novel was \u201cDying is Fun,\u201d a grotesquely apt characterization of a sadly apt conceit. After producing 138 notecards\u2019 worth of material for <i>The Original of Laura</i>, Nabokov died himself at 78.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the irony: that Nabokov wrote Wild trying to erase Wild in spite of Nabokov, and that Nabokov was thwarted in thwarting Wild\u2019s self-erasure by Nabokov\u2019s own erasure. One thinks of Escher\u2019s <i>Drawing Hands</i>, except here we have two pencils, and at the end of each of those pencils is an eraser. \r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhether or not he would have appreciated this one in his own life, Nabokov was generally fond of such tragic loops. <i>Lolita</i>, <i>Laughter in the Dark</i>, and <i>The Enchanter</i>, to name a few, center around characters with obsessions that are both destructive and regressive: fantastic attempts to restore the past that invariably lead to profound loss. This irony\u2014that the search for what is lost yields only deeper loss\u2014is central to Nabokov\u2019s pathetic conception of time, and essential in understanding the closely-related functions of exile, memory, and nostalgia in his work. Time and its casualties are inescapable; attempting to resist or subvert time leads Nabokov\u2019s characters to madness, or else forces whole novels into ontological paradox (i.a. <i>The Eye</i>, <i>The Gift</i>).\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWith lives, even fictional ones, the inevitability of time\u2019s passing implies the inevitability of death. And there\u2014in death\u2014lies nature\u2019s artistic authority: finally calling the shots, nature picks up where the human artist left off.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis situation of nature\u2019s imitating and thwarting art is further complicated by the strange circumstances of the novel\u2019s publication. On his deathbed, Nabokov asked his wife and son to destroy the manuscript of <i>The Original of Laura</i>. Whether his son Dmitri was ethically justified in publishing it instead is hard to say; what is clear is that Nabokov </i>p\u00e8re</i> had, and continues to have, no choice in the matter.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDmitri Nabokov has commented that the character Philip Wild only sought to commit a \u201creversible suicide,\u201d whereby he could return to life after erasing himself. Such brash plans do not tend to succeed in the real world, as Nabokov the naturalist would surely have known. But was Nabokov the artist seeking exactly that sort of artist\u2019s immortality for his manuscript? Did he in fact hope <i>The Original of Laura</i> would be published despite his instructions? As Dmitri has noted in his own defense, Nabokov\u2019s wife, V\u00e9ra, once rescued the pages of <i>Lolita</i> from an incinerator where Nabokov was about to burn them, and history has justified her in doing so. So was Nabokov\u2019s last request a \u201cfriendly little push\u201d into the naturalist\u2019s incinerator\u2014or was it an artist\u2019s last \u201cfriendly little push\u201d back at death?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the other irony: that while nature had the last laugh when it came to Nabokov\u2019s artistic legacy, his scientific legacy was marked by a generous sprinkling of poetic justice. In 1977, Nabokov died. In 2009, <i>The Original of Laura</i> was published just as he left it: as a farrago of 138 pencil-marked notecards, awkwardly reproduced in hardcover (Knopf; $35). On January 26, 2011, a study was published by Pierce et. al. which supported Nabokov\u2019s original hypothesis on the migration of the <i>Polyommatus</i> blues. Next-generation DNA sequencing stunningly <a  href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/science/01butterfly.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2\">confirmed</a> that \u201che got every one right\u201d regarding five waves of butterflies which indeed flew across the Bering Strait from Asia over the last eleven million years. Nabokov\u2019s \u201cfriendly little push\u201d had panned out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOtherwise-astute Pnin was mistaken: however whimsical its style, Nabokov\u2019s scientific work was no pose. In fact, it proved to be one of the hardiest parts of his legacy, as augured in Nabokov\u2019s own poem \u201cA Discovery\u201d (1941):\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\u201c[\u2026] I found it and I named it, being versed<br>\r\n\r\nin taxonomic Latin; thus became<br>\r\ngodfather to an insect and its first<br>\r\ndescriber \u2013 and I want no other fame.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWide open on its pin (though fast asleep),<br>\r\nand safe from creeping relatives and rust,<br>\r\nin the secluded stronghold where we keep<br>\r\ntype specimens it will transcend its dust.<br><br>\r\n\r\nDark pictures, thrones, the stones that pilgrims kiss,<br>\r\n\r\npoems that take a thousand years to die<br>\r\nbut ape the immortality of this<br>\r\nred label on a little butterfly.\u201d<br>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMore fitting than Pnin\u2019s in this case may be the words of <i>Pale Fire</i>\u2019s John Shade, who speculates, \u201cLife is a great surprise. I do not see why death should not be an even greater one.\u201d The \u201cgreat surprise\u201d of Nabokov\u2019s posthumous legacy was that all expectations were reversed: the notion of his belletristic invulnerability was shaken, while his scientific audacity was unexpectedly vindicated. His death revealed the fallibility and humanity behind what was truly his great pose, his literature\u2014and it confirmed that his entomology was not a pose at all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nArtists spend their lives preparing for death, but they never prepare sufficiently. Nabokov, for all his genius, was no exception: <i>The Original of Laura</i> reveals, by its very imperfection, the limits of Nabokov\u2019s control over his art. And while Nabokov the naturalist finally got his due in death, a better known Nabokov\u2014Nabokov the natural, Nabokov the master jester\u2014failed, at last, to perfect\u2014what? Only this: the final, most natural gesture. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

Where could this have really come from in heads like the ones we have, we men of noble descent, happy, successful, from the best society, noble, and virtuous?\u2019\u2014for hundreds of years the aristocratic Greek posed this question to himself in relation to every horror or outrage incomprehensible to him which had defiled one of his peers. \u2018Some god must have deluded him,\u2019 he finally said, shaking his head . . .\u201d \u2013 Friedrich Nietzsche, <i>On the Genealogy of Morality</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\u201cMyths are stories about people who become too big for their lives temporarily, so that they crash into other lives or brush against gods.\u201d \u2013 Anne Carson, <i>Grief Lessons</i>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>1</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn that impossible litany of outrage, rape and desecration which constitutes Greek mythology, the house of Atreus stands out not for the extremity of its crimes\u2014there it has equals\u2014but for its capacity to survive them. Generation after generation, beginning four lifetimes before the Trojan War and persisting through Atreus, Thyestes, Agamemnon, Menelaus, and down to the time of Orestes and Elektra, commits the most heinous and unthinkable crimes ever to blacken a man\u2019s soul and yet survives long enough to pass on its cursed seed. The Greek myths are filled with mortals who transgress the bounds of their mortality, of course. The Atreids are exceptional only in that they manage to survive beyond these bounds, at least for a while. To take on unspeakable guilt and live with it: this is their curse.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf we formalize memory\u2014if we allow it to be, not a picture of the past that we carry with us, but simply the way the past presses on us, the way it holds itself apart and refuses to disappear into the present\u2014then a curse is a kind of memory, indeed an essential kind. A curse is an excess of memory, the unforgettable\u2014and for that it doesn\u2019t need to be remembered. The famine upon Thebes at the opening of <i>Oedipus Rex</i> is a kind of memory of Oedipus\u2019 parricide, which he himself never knew as such and has now forgotten: beyond what he knows or can know, Oedipus is hunted down by the effects of an action he believed he could put behind him. That he was wrong, that this particular past is his fate\u2014this is a kind of memory. The curse is the way a crime, like a promise, catches up with you\u2014the way the past, as past, recurs. For Oedipus, this recurrence means simply death: not only he but every one of his children is consumed by the past he has forgotten and which, in the form of Iocasta, has remained all too near. This was not to be the fate of the Atreids; theirs was worse. For them, the past kept happening, in an endless proliferation of linked and varied crimes which at once punished and deepened their guilt, for centuries. But how did it begin?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>2</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTantalus was a wealthy king of Lydia, beloved of the gods in an age when men still broke bread with the gods. He was a regular guest at their table in Olympus, and it is said that he talked too much of their secrets and stole ambrosia to share with his mortal friends. Whatever the truth of this, the Olympians apparently forgave him, because when he invited them to dine at his palace they agreed. The gods arrived and sat down to the feast, but when the dishes were laid out and uncovered they fell silent. They recognized, instantly, that Tantalus had served them human flesh\u2014the flesh of his son Pelops. Only Demeter, grieved to distraction by the recent kidnapping of Persephone, took a bite. But she quickly realized what she had done\u2014and she was horrified. They all were.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe gods sought to undo what Tantalus had done: they rebuilt Pelops from the ground up. They placed his bones in a cauldron and called on the Fates to restore him to life; Hephaestus crafted a shoulder for him out of ivory to replace the one Demeter had eaten. He emerged more beautiful than before. As for Tantalus, their punishment for him is well-known: he was condemned to live forever in Hades, always on the point of starvation with fruit just out of reach, always desperately thirsty but never quite able to drink. But the effects of his crime were not to be undone so simply.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>3</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOddly enough, Tantalus was not the only Greek to offer the flesh of his son to the gods. The Arcadian king Lycaon did so too, thinking to test Zeus\u2019s omniscience. Zeus, of course, passed the test, and promptly killed all fifty of Lycaon\u2019s other sons in retribution\u2014but that he was so tested speaks volumes about the nature of the Olympians. As Roberto Calasso points out, \u201cOf the Olympians, the first thing we can say is that they were <i>new</i> gods.\u201d They ruled, but in the background of everything they did there lurked an older, darker order\u2014that of the Titans, the Fates and the Furies, faceless, impersonal and terrifying beings. When he approaches cannibalism, Zeus himself approaches a realm in which he does not rule.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis, then, was Tantalus\u2019 crime: he tempted the gods to transgression. That he killed his own son is horrifying, of course, but that he sought to involve the gods themselves in his crime--this is strictly unforgivable. For the Greeks, cannibalism and the killing of one\u2019s children, often closely linked, are among the darkest crimes imaginable, rivaled only by incest. (What do they share? Perhaps simply this: incest, parricide, filicide, and cannibalism are all claustrophobic. They place the agent too close to the victim.) When Hera wants to destroy Heracles, she makes him kill his three sons; when Procne must avenge herself on her husband for her sister\u2019s rape, she makes him eat his children. The guilt flowing from these crimes is so profound, so penetrating, that it can render even the gods impure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe gods differ from mortals here not because they are above the law but because they possess the insight to avoid breaking it. This marks the difference between gods and mortals perhaps more deeply than death itself: the gods never find themselves in the position of Oedipus, suddenly and unimaginably guilty. They are able to avoid actions whose consequences they cannot control; mortals risk such consequences in their every action.<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup> And perhaps it is even a kindness that transgression and death go hand in hand, that those who cannot die need not sin: for one who has broken the law which even the gods fear, the best thing is to die quickly. This release, however, is denied to Tantalus. His punishment, an endless and desperate desire for what is always just beyond his grasp, is a cruel parody of life, a life-in-death. But the life of Tantalus\u2019 crime does not end there: because Tantalus tempted the gods to unspeakable crime, his descendants will heap crime on crime endlessly. They are cursed not with leprosy or poverty or death but with the perseverance and madness to become ever more accursed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>4</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf Tantalus thus marks an unfortunate beginning, he also marks an end: the end of social exchange between gods and mortals. Perhaps the gods learn their lesson. Three generations later, in the time of Agamemnon, the gods are guests of mortals only in distant lands (Zeus begins the <i>Iliad</i> vacationing among the Ethiopians); a generation after that, in the time of Orestes, even this seems unthinkable. In Tantalus\u2019 time, the line which divides men from gods remained permeable; after him it will become a terrifying borderland, the unthinkable limit of the mortal world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis limit, this difference, is absolute, but it is not for that reason impassable. Indeed, the moments at which it is crossed provide most of the material for Greek myth. From the gods\u2019 side, the transgression is erotic: an endless series of rapes and abductions, along with the mortals produced by these couplings and the ensuing entanglement of divine with mortal affairs. (The Trojan War itself is the aftermath of Zeus\u2019s love for Leda; Helen the all-too-beautiful is the grim consequence of this union.) \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFrom the mortal side, the line is marked primarily by the sacrificial knife: the divine enters into mortal life by way of a gift which is also a death. The sacrifice produces between gods and mortals a connection which is also a separation. Sacrifice is the way mortals acknowledge the absolute difference of the divine, and this acknowledgment must be forever repeated, because mortals run the risk of forgetting it. When it is forgotten, men enter dangerous territory, and a myth occurs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis forgetting may happen in two ways. The first of these is well known: it is hubris, the inveterate mortal urge to challenge the gods. The second, more obscure, more penetrating way in which mortals approach the border of the divine is less well known: it is <i>at\u00eb</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn later Greek, <i>at\u00eb</i> came to mean simply \u201cdisaster,\u201d and it is usually so translated. But it has an older and more ambiguous meaning. <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29%2Fth\">Liddell-Scott defines</a> it first as \u201c<i>bewilderment, infatuation,</i> caused by <i>blindness</i> or <i>delusion</i> sent by the gods, mostly as the punishment of guilty rashness.\u201d <i>At\u00eb</i> appears here as a divine punishment, but a strange form of punishment: loss of oneself, mania, madness, but also possession, \u201cinfatuation.\u201d (Think of the bestial desire of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasipha%C3%AB\">Pasipha\u00eb</a> and the incestuous love of her daughter, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedra_%28mythology%29\">Phaedra</a>, both divine punishments.) But strangely enough, <i>at\u00eb</i> can also mean \u201cthe consequences of such visitations, either (a) reckless guilt, sin or (b) bane, ruin.\u201d <i>At\u00eb</i>, then, is not only punishment but also the incitement to crime; this double meaning is drawn together into the single meaning \u201cdisaster\u201d because the insane crime caused by divine madness was the most profound disaster the Greeks could imagine\u2014a disaster which consumes both victim and agent, one in which crime and punishment are the same. And such crime is, in an obscure sense, divine. In Sophocles\u2019 <i>Antigone</i>, the chorus, watching the implacable determination of Creon and Antigone send them both into ruin, comments: \r\n<blockquote>\r\nYour power, great Zeus\u2014what human overstepping can check it? Yours is power that neither Sleep, the all-ensnaring, nor the untiring months of the gods can defeat. Unaged through time, you rule by your power and dwell thereby in the brilliant splendor of Olympus. And through the future, both near and distant, as through the past, shall this law prevail: nothing that is great comes to the life of mortals without <i>at\u00eb</i>. \r\n</blockquote>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>5</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTantalus had three children. Of the first, Broteas, we know little besides that he was very ugly. The second, Niobe, lived primarily to produce an object lesson in hubris. She had fourteen children, and one fine day she took it upon herself to comment that she was a more blessed mother than Leto, who had only two. Unfortunately for Niobe, Leto\u2019s two children were Artemis and Apollo, and those cold gods punished her by exterminating every one of her children. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNiobe\u2019s story, like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachne\">Arachne\u2019s</a>, is a mere parable\u2014its lesson is simple and its consequences limited. Hubris is a kind of self-forgetting characteristic of mortals. We forget not that we cannot equal the gods in accomplishment\u2014the Greeks are beautifully unsure on that point, and indeed Ovid claims that Arachne was a better weaver than Athena\u2014but simply that we are mortals, that every work and deed of ours is vulnerable to death right up to the moment when it dies.  For this reason, hubris is self-correcting: one dies.<sup><a name=\"id2\" href=\"#ft2\">2</a></sup> Artemis and Apollo merely make explicit with their arrows what would have been true anyway: Niobe will die, and her children, and theirs, while Leto\u2019s children will live forever. Ovid tells us that when Niobe died, no one in her city mourned her.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>6</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf hubris, the forgetting of mortality, dies with its bearer, <i>at\u00eb</i>, a more radical form of forgetting, has more lasting consequences. The task of revealing these is left to Tantalus\u2019 third child, Pelops, and to his progeny.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPelops himself does not experience <i>at\u00eb</i> in its full form; perhaps he is protected by his ivory shoulder, the mark of the gods. He is remembered chiefly for finding a wife worthy of the son of Tantalus, and for accumulating the many curses whose consequences fall upon his sons.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter he emerges from the cauldron, Pelops is so beautiful that he is immediately abducted by Poseidon and serves as his catamite for a few years. Once he has outgrown this role, he sets out to seek the hand of Hippodemeia, daughter of Oenomaus. Oenomaus is a cruel king, and his love for his daughter transgresses the bounds of fatherhood; he has already killed thirteen suitors in order to keep her and plans to persist in this practice until he has accumulated enough bones to build a temple to Ares. But Hippodemeia, perhaps bored with this arrangement, takes a shine to Pelops; she betrays and kills her father by seducing his charioteer, and he curses Pelops and all his children with his dying breath. Pelops then kills the charioteer, who curses him and all his children with his dying breath.<sup><a name=\"id3\" href=\"#ft3\">3</a></sup> \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n Through ruthless determination, Pelops came to rule a vast swath of Greece, the Peloponnesus, which bears his name to this day. His reign is remembered for a single perfidious act: he invited an enemy king to parley and then killed him under the flag of truce. For this crime all of Greece was punished with several years of famine.\r\n </p>\r\n \r\n <p>\r\nNonetheless, in light of the sins of his father and those of his sons, Pelops\u2019 own misdeeds look merely venal: unlike Tantalus before him and Thyestes after him, Pelops kills only to achieve ends. He seems unable to take a single step without accumulating greater guilt, but he is never taken with divine madness. His worst punishment is similarly limited: he loses his favorite son.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPelops fathered many sons with Hippodemeia, most notably Atreus and Thyestes, but his favorite son was Chrysippus, borne to him by the nymph Axioche, and he would have liked to leave his kingdom to this son. Hippodemeia, with the collusion of Atreus and Thyestes, killed Chrysippus out of envy; when Pelops discovered her crime, he exiled Atreus and Thyestes and Hippodemeia hanged herself. Her sons went off to seek their fortune in Mycenae, which at that time (unlucky city!) had an empty throne.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>7</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAtreus and Thyestes were doomed to be enemies from the moment they killed their father\u2019s rightful heir: they had rejected their father\u2019s decision and now each could establish predominance only with the other\u2019s blood. But the degree of their rivalry, the extent and variety of the crimes they commit against each other, extended beyond any conceivable political goal, beyond any end whatsoever. They hated each other as only brothers can, in a way that\u2019s more than human.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey fought over the throne of Mycenae, of course; Thyestes seduced his brother\u2019s wife to wrest it away, and Atreus convinced Zeus to make the very stars run backward so he could win it back. The sun, to settle their quarrel, set in the east for the first and only time. But this was only the beginning.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAtreus exiled Thyestes, but he was not satisfied\u2014so he invited him back and prepared a feast in his honor. When Thyestes had eaten his fill, Atreus brought out a bowl filled with human hands and feet, and Thyestes understood that he had eaten his own children. He fled, cursing Atreus and all his children.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAtreus\u2019 crime elegantly combined those of his father and his grandfather: he violated a truce like Pelops, by serving children like Tantalus. If Tantalus\u2019 crime was a perversion of the relationship between god and man, a poisoned sacrifice, Atreus\u2019 was the perversion of the relationship between guest and host, a poisoned feast. But why? Why not simply kill Thyestes? This, subsequent events will show, would have been much the wiser course. But it is as though Atreus\u2019 lust for vengeance could not be satisfied by something so simple: he needed a revenge which was excessive, which exceeded even death.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is with this excess in Atreus that <i>at\u00eb</i> in its pure form enters the story. One recognizes true <i>at\u00eb</i> by two signs. First, <i>at\u00eb</i> must be inhuman, at once more and less than human: it must exceed the limits set by mortality. Atreus cannot be satisfied with the death of his enemy, with a human revenge; he has to call down the divine, to put Thyestes on the wrong side of the oldest laws. Second, <i>at\u00eb</i> consumes everything it touches; it renders both victim and criminal unclean, it erases the distinction between avenger and avanged, between aggressor and victim. Atreus\u2019 crime is so terrible that neither he nor his enemy will live it down. Such acts will not be forgotten, will not exhaust themselves in the moment of action; they expand outward to contaminate observers, bloodlines, cities.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThese two characteristics are linked: a more-than-human act cannot be contained in the human world, its consequences cannot exhaust themselves in the destruction of mere mortals, its reverberations do not die away. When he acts out of <i>at\u00eb</i>, a man passes beyond the bounds of mortality, into the dark world of the oldest gods. In hubris, men forget that they are mortal; in <i>at\u00eb</i> they forget the very boundaries which make mortal life possible. Once these boundaries are crossed, mortal action is unavailing; only the gods can restore them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>8</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt this point in the story, if Thyestes were a tragic character, if he had any shame, if he were human, he would kill himself. Instead he went to the Oracle at Delphi to ask what must have been one of the most difficult questions that oracle had ever answered: how could he wreak adequate vengeance on Atreus? The oracle answered implacably, incomprehensibly: \u201cRape your daughter.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe deep complicity of the gods in this story, the extent to which all the Atreids\u2019 sins are punishment for Tantalus\u2019 crime, becomes evident in this divine command. But really, what could be more logical? Atreus had exhausted the possibilities of one great taboo, that of cannibalism; Thyestes would have to seek out the consequences of the other great sin, incest. He would need, as it were, to seek inspiration from his mother\u2019s side of the family. That it was to be Thyestes, not Atreus, who committed incest\u2014that Thyestes was invited to take on yet another great crime, and not told how this would help him\u2014hardly mattered: a sin so great was bound to ensnare Atreus somehow.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo Thyestes set off for Sicyon, where his daughter Pelopia was priestess. He hid in the bushes to watch her perform a sacrifice, and in the course of the rite she was stained with blood. When she went off to the river to cleanse herself, Thyestes leapt out and raped her. She did not recognize him, but struggled desperately and managed to take his sword. Thyestes fled.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSoon afterward, Atreus came to Sicyon and took a shine to Pelopia, not recognizing her as his niece. He asked for her hand in marriage, and it was granted. Nine months later, she gave birth to a child, Aegisthus, whom Atreus believed was his and raised as his own son.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nWhen Aegisthus was still a boy, Atreus at last managed to capture Thyestes and imprisoned him. Kind father that he was, Atreus offered Aegisthus the opportunity to kill his old enemy, and Aegisthus entered the dungeon to do so. The sword he carried was a gift from his mother.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThyestes, however, was not to be killed so easily: he wrested the sword from his son, recognized it as his own, and ordered Aegisthus to call his mother. Pelopia entered the dungeon, saw Thyestes, understood instantly by whom she had been raped, and killed herself with the sword in front of her son. Aegisthus showed his father the bloody sword and told him the deed was done. When Atreus went out to sacrifice a ram in thanksgiving, Aegisthus slaughtered him instead, yet another perverted sacrifice. Thus Thyestes regained the throne of Mycenae.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt must be said again: Thyestes and Aegisthus ought to die. Thyestes, child-eater, incestuous father, fratricide, and Aegisthus, the child of incest, half-parricide twice over: they ought to do as Oedipus did, flee the company of men, gouge out their eyes. But they do not; they are Tantalus\u2019 children, doomed to repeat his sins without peace forever. They live on. So too does Atreus\u2019 line. His sons, Agamemnon and Menelaus, flee to Sparta, where they have the good fortune to win the hands of Clytemnestra and Helen, respectively\u2014a double-edged sword if ever there was one. So the story continues.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>9</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War\">tale of Menelaus and Agamemnon</a> is well-known and need not be repeated here. For our purposes we need only note that, with Agamemnon, something new emerges\u2014the beginning of the end, even. Agamemnon is in many ways a figure of <i>at\u00eb</i>; the Iliad opens with his insane decision, against all advice, to hold on to the daughter of a priest of Apollo, thus bringing ruin on his army camped outside the walls of Troy. When he is at last forced to give her up, he immediately seizes Achilles\u2019 woman as a replacement, thus provoking without the least justification\r\n\t<blockquote>\r\n\tAchilles\u2019 anger, doomed and ruinous,<br />\r\n\tthat caused the Achaeans loss on bitter loss<br />\r\n\tand crowded brave souls into the undergloom,<br />\r\n\tleaving so many dead men\u2014carrion<br />\r\n\tfor dogs and birds; and the will of Zeus was done.<br />\r\n\t</blockquote>\r\nBut Agamemnon\u2019s greatest crime, the one for which his wife Clytemnestra will kill him, is different: it is, strictly speaking, the fault of a goddess. Stopping at Aulis on his way to Troy, Agamemnon kills a deer in a grove sacred to Artemis and then brags that he is a better hunter than the huntress herself. For this utterly trivial and laughably hubristic act, Artemis becalms his fleet, and a soothsayer reveals that she will allow them to proceed only if Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter Iphigenia.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nAgamemnon kills his daughter unwillingly, for a <i>raison d\u2019\u00c9tat</i>. His sacrifice is a true sacrifice, demanded by the gods of an unwilling human. When the oracle tells Thyestes to rape his daughter, it merely places a weapon in his hands, but Artemis requires Agamemnon to strike the blow. He does so out of duty.<sup><a name=\"id4\" href=\"#ft4\">4</a></sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>10</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nThis split between the actor and the act is unprecedented in the story so far. Tantalus acts for no reason at all, Pelops out of ambition, Atreus and Thyestes out of wrath; each is entirely united with his crime, none has cause to ask why it falls into his hands. With Agamemnon a new space opens up between the actor and his action. Two new questions emerge.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFirst, the properly political comes into play here for the first time. Agamemnon has a duty as father, but he has a higher duty as king. This is more than a conflict of motives, it is a conflict of worlds: no mediation, no balance is possible here. At the limit, a choice must be made, and whichever path one chooses, one will not be forgiven. Agamemnon\u2019s reasons for sacrificing Iphigenia are good enough, or they are not, but Clytemnestra will avenge her daughter either way. Hegel argued that for the Greeks, fate just was this conflict, this impossible choice; we may suspend judgment on that point. In any case the question will remain central to Greek thought for centuries, will achieve its ambiguous suspension in Socrates and its apotheosis in Antigone.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe second, related, dimension of this space we might broadly call psychology. No longer is the actor made entirely manifest in his act, no longer is he at one with the world; hence his motives become questionable, his act requires interpretation. The notion of \u201cunconscious\u201d motive, of the motive hidden even from its bearer, is of course foreign to the Greeks, which is why I am hesitant to use the term\u2014the space between actor and action here is not the impassable divide it has become for us. To say that the acts require interpretation is merely to say that they require speech, the speech of the actor. Thyestes did not need to speak, his acts could not be misunderstood\u2014but with Agamemnon there is a distance between will and deed, so there is a question.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe opening of these two dimensions\u2014the political and the psychological\u2014gives birth to a new form of art: the tragedy. Greek tragedy exists in the split between actor and action, between fate and the individual; it is a poetry of questionable actions and the speech which seeks to explain them. And it is with Agamemnon that the house of Atreus becomes for the first time tragic; it is with the story of his children that Aeschylus invents the form. Homer did not write about the sacrifice of Iphigenia, and this is proper: it is not the stuff of epic. For adequate treatment it had to await Euripides.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nWhat does all this mean for <i>at\u00eb</i>? To be sure, <i>at\u00eb</i> is not absent from tragedy\u2014in <i>Medea</i>, for example, it exists in its full form. And the crime which contaminates victim and agent in the same breath, the crime whose effects can shake a city, is the tragic subject par excellence. But something has changed: the tragic hero is the criminal who confronts his crime, who sooner or later must stare it in the face. It happens sooner for Antigone, who knows her doom and takes it upon her virtually the moment she comes on stage, and later for Oedipus, who spends all of <i>Oedipus Rex</i> understanding what he is. But it happens\u2014the moment of self-consciousness unknown to Atreus and just barely glimpsed by Agamemnon. And this minimal difference, this hesitation before the deed, creates the possibility\u2014ambiguous, occasional, just barely there\u2014of redemption.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>11</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so we come to Orestes. His father Agamemnon returns to Greece after a decade of war only to be slaughtered by his mother, who has meanwhile been seduced by cousin Aegisthus. (In one version, not that of Aeschylus, it is Aegisthus who kills Agamemnon, and he does it like a good Atreid, by inviting him to a feast.) Orestes is thus placed in an impossible position, precisely Hamlet\u2019s position: failing to avenge his father would render him accursed, but killing his mother would be worse. His sister Electra does not hesitate, she wants nothing more than to kill her mother\u2014she would do it herself, but it\u2019s a man\u2019s job. Orestes, however, in a moment with no precedent among all his ancestors, hesitates. He is squeamish. Like his uncle, he goes to Delos to seek advice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Oracle displays about as much forbearance here as it did with Thyestes: Apollo tells him that he will be cursed with leprosy and hateful to the gods if he fails to avenge his father. Recognizing that a matricide will provoke the wrath of the Furies, Apollo gives him a bow with which to fight them off. Orestes returns home and kills his mother.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Furies swoop down on him to wreak their revenge; they give him to understand that he will never be forgiven. Apollo\u2019s bow doesn\u2019t work, it provides only momentary relief: Apollo is out of his depth here. These are older gods. Orestes wanders throughout Greece, from river to river and shrine to shrine, purifying himself in each of them: nothing works. In ancient times there was a shrine in Arcadia called Finger Rock, sacred to Orestes; it marks the place where he bit off his finger, no longer able to bear his pain. But the pain continued.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt last Orestes, following the advice of Apollo, came to Athens. No one welcomed him, no one offered him food or rest: he was contaminated, and they feared contamination. Later he was given a little wine, but made to drink it alone, at a separate table, from a separate vessel. Finally, at the instigation of Athena, a trial was organized: the council of Athens would consider whether to forgive Orestes, and the Furies would abide by their decision. The trial turned on the question of parentage: which was more important, a mother or a father? Apollo himself played Orestes\u2019 lawyer, arguing that the mother is a mere vessel, hardly a relative, merely a container for the father\u2019s seed: that a child\u2019s first loyalty must lie with his father. Even so, the council was divided, split right down the middle. Athena herself, the motherless goddess, cast the deciding vote for absolution. So ends the story of the curse of the Atreids.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>12</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nA strange and portentous ending. It marks, first, the final victory of the new gods over the old, the establishment of Olympian preeminence over Fates and Furies. But the victory is ambiguous, perhaps Pyrrhic\u2014the opening of the Athenian age is also the beginning of the end of the Greek gods. For Socrates and his companions they were not so much false as irrelevant: the concerns of the city came first, the gods were unknowable and perhaps unimportant. It is as though, when the Olympians lose their connection with darker gods, they lose their force. After all, if a god is thinkable, does he remain a god?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe trial of Orestes also marks the apotheosis of the city, and of Athens in particular. In Euripides\u2019 <i>Heracles</i>, Athens will play a similar absolving role in the figure of its hero, Theseus: Heracles, having killed his children in a fit of Hera-sent madness, wants only to kill himself, but his friend Theseus arrives on the scene to offer another way out. Theseus suggests that absolution can replace destruction because friendship can replace family: a voluntary association governed by human will can hold out when the natural and divine bond of family has given way. The trial of Orestes suggests something similar: that the council of the city can hold out against older, deeper family ties.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn a certain sense, the trial also represents a victory of thought over memory. If speech first comes on the scene with Agamemnon, reason begins with Orestes: his case can be argued, we can weigh motives and consider justice here. We can ask what he ought to have done. Thought gains primacy over the deed; Orestes can be wrested from the weight of his guilt and that of his ancestors through argument. If we can understand his act we can forget it, and allow him to do the same.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd yet\u2014the council is divided, and Apollo cannot absolve Orestes except by making nothing of motherhood. Plato is yet more categorical: in <i>The Republic</i>, the full being of the city depends on the total destruction of the family. The very extremity of these solutions suggests their failure: the bright light of the agora can banish <i>at\u00eb</i> to its borders, but cannot destroy it. We know now that guilt is thinkable and forgivable, that a man is more than his past and can live it down\u2014but something essential is elided here, something is not redeemed. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\">\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nA fascinating contrast between the insight of gods and that of mortals is provided in the story of Achilles\u2019 mother, Thetis. Zeus falls in love with Thetis, but before he can seduce her it is prophesied that Thetis will bear a son greater than his father. Zeus, a parricide himself, has no interest in fathering such a son. He shows restraint in love for the first and last time, and Thetis is married off to a mortal, Peleus, to whom she bears Achilles. Achilles is, as it were, the son Zeus never had\u2014and disaster is averted. Oedipus\u2019 father, too, receives a dark prophecy about his son\u2014but he is mortal, and it avails him nothing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft2\" href=\"#id2\">2</a></sup>\r\nSolon\u2019s advice that one should call no man happy or blessed until he is dead becomes, in its Greek context, a sort of cruel joke at the expense of us mortals. Solon prudently reminds us that we should suspend judgment on the apparently happy man, because a reversal of fortune is always possible\u2014but of course, for a mortal, a reversal of fortune is certain.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft3\" href=\"#id3\">3</a></sup>\r\nIt is said that when Iphigenia was to be sacrificed, she was gagged so that she could not curse her family with her dying breath\u2014such curses were no small thing.

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nThe ship lands on the planet, drawn there by insatiable greed, to be sure, but also, as soon becomes apparent, by mere bloodlust, the perverse desire to destroy what isn\u2019t of it. Along with its war machines, the ship carries one of its victims: a man who, though broken by the violence of his people, remains inexplicably devoted to this violence. The planet is green, harmonious, inhabited by the sort of not-quite-human beings who, when they hunt, thank the spirits of the animals they kill; these beings are themselves holistic, harmonic, vegetarian in spirit if not in practice, and they worship a tree which provides for their needs. The damaged boy meets a girl who takes him into her holistic world and teaches him what\u2019s really important. The boy learns well, discovers a kind of sex which is about love and understanding each other\u2019s needs, and, when called upon, saves the holistic tree from the violent, greedy, lustful demands of his people.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cAvatar\u201d (2009) represents to perfection a certain contemporary understanding of the relationship between man and nature. Nature is peaceful, passive even in its activity; if home is the place where everything is in its place and all is provided for, the realm of peace, nature is more homelike than home. For all these reasons, nature is a woman. Man is violent, angry, driven by greed and lust; he can find no pleasure except in possession, and knows no \u201ctrue happiness\u201d at all. \u201cMan\u201d is here manifestly masculine. The relationship between man and nature, in its first moment, is roughly that of the abusive boyfriend to the all-forgiving and rather helpless battered woman: man is guilty before nature, all the more guilty because he really does love her and could be happy with her if he could find it in his heart to be kind for once. Nature tries to save him, to let him see what\u2019s really important, but alas, he refuses, he only continues to beat her. But the abusive boyfriend hurts himself as much as anyone else; he is one of those lonely men who hurt anyone who tries to love them. (Such men fail to be genuinely tragic only because they so obviously pity themselves.)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the second moment<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup>\u2014the moment of fantasy, of wish-fulfillment\u2014man finally does understand. He accepts the gifts of nature, so freely given; he too becomes \u201cnatural,\u201d returns home. He slows down, he calms his greed and lust, he begins to understand that life isn\u2019t all about the pointless exploitation of natural resources. And better still, in becoming \u201cnatural,\u201d he saves nature: his transformation is the only thing that can save the holistic, domestic way of life. (If history has taught us anything it\u2019s that the blue people certainly can\u2019t save themselves.) Man and nature complement each other perfectly in the end: man must become feminine, emasculated, and in a certain sense domestic to save himself, but nature in turn needs man to defend her. Nature\u2019s survival, because it is dependent on his ethical transformation, becomes the symbol of his newfound virtue; nature is saved and man is, at last, happy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis construct\u2014nature as the battered woman\u2014is, I think, characteristic of a certain strain of modern liberal politics. Nature figures here as a strictly passive element; that we are destroying her speaks not to our imprudence but to a deeper guilt, our need to constantly expand, conquer and consume. Our guilt is our failure to find peace or happiness; nature is merely the abused object which gives substance to this guilt; we imagine increased skin cancer and melting icecaps as fitting punishments for the damage we\u2019re doing. One hears echoes of such a model everywhere, from talk of our \u201coil addiction\u201d to sadistic PETA propaganda material to the tracts of the Slow Food movement. \u201cWe as a society\u201d (a characteristic manner of speaking in this context, ambiguous as it is concerning who exactly is guilty) are too fast, too greedy, too aggressive; nature is the victim required by our ethical failures.<sup><a name=\"id2\" href=\"#ft2\">2</a></sup> We can save nature only by redeeming ourselves. A new way of dramatizing the nature-culture distinction organizes a new kind of politics (society will find peace only by recognizing itself as guilty) and a new kind of ethics (the subject will find peace only as peace with nature).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis dramatization marks a sharp break with the nature-myth which has oriented a good deal of political thought in the past century: that of man as an organizing, civilizing force faced with the task of bringing peace and order to an anarchic and feminized nature. This myth, which informed everything from justifications of colonization to Socialist Realism to spaghetti westerns, cast man (embodied in reason, technology, and self-control) as the agent of potential salvation; man at once proved himself and fulfilled his destiny precisely by taming nature. This idea has, I think, shattered against the force of events\u2014a hard-won mistrust of civilization, technology, reason and perhaps man itself has become ubiquitous in our culture. Yet it lives a strange, inverted afterlife in the myth I have been describing: the idea that nature should tame man.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat is the value of all this? The answer is complex. Politically speaking, the new myth commits the original and constitutive sin of left-liberal politics: it misrecognizes a political problem as an ethical failure. It is not, of course, \u201cwe\u201d who demand too many resources, who find ourselves unable to stop expanding and consuming although we know it will bring us no true happiness; it is capitalism which does these things. It is capitalism which cannot help but eat rainforests, and no amount of holistic locavore anti-consumerism will affect this in the least. Politically speaking, the attribution of global warming to fat, greedy, SUV-driving Americans is the worst kind of political dead end: by casting nature as the victim, environmental politics limits its sphere of influence to those who enjoy feeling knowingly guilty. This class, though surprisingly numerous, will never be a majority.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut the myth of the nature-victim constitutes a subjectivity which is ultimately more ethical than political, a sort of updated unhappy consciousness: one for whom unhappiness refers directly to an ethical failure figured as a failure to partake in nature. This position will have ambiguous consequences beyond its political manifestation, but its precise import remains obscure. It does not suit my taste\u2014it renders nature (woman) boring and civilization (man) sinful\u2014but it suggests a certain promise which places it beyond the myriad marketed self-help doctrines which have passed for an ethics in America for so long. This movement\u2019s concern for practice and physicality\u2014for food, exercise, sleep, self-care\u2014sets it apart, as does its explicit recognition of dissatisfaction with the world. Perhaps the new spirituality will turn out to be richer than tree-worship; we\u2019ll see.\r\n <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\"><p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nFor an early version of this narrative entirely lacking in the second moment, cf.

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nThe first two flags I saw were like this: one flew on a pole in front of my school, and it was a wide rectangle that folded and ribboned in the wind, and the blue square studded with stars on the left came in and out of view, and the red and white stripes whipped around like the flash of a racecar on a track. A static version of this bright notion was hung in our classroom. To me it looked ugly indoors. Every morning we had to pray to it, standing, our hands over our small hearts. This is what we said:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe other flag I knew best was hardly ever let loose on the wind. It was hung in windows and painted on murals, people wore it on T-shirts, and it appeared in miniature on the packages of corn tortillas we bought for quesadillas. It also had stripes, but they were different: three vertical bars of color, first green, then white, then red. In the white bar lived a fantastic creature: a fearsome, feral eagle devouring a serpent, perched on a cactus growing from a rock. I did not know how it got there\u2014on the flag, I mean. How did it invade that white space, that strict idea of the nation-state, with its pledges and borders and rules about what to do in the morning before math class?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn college I felt drawn to this other flag, and sat shyly in a corner at the meetings for MEChA, a chapter of the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl\u00e1n. These students were vigorous organizers, heirs to the heroic tradition of C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, and I wanted in. But I second-guessed myself, as though I needed to know who I was in order to know where to stand. I got caught up in preliminary questions: what did the \u201cChicano Student Movement of Aztl\u00e1n\u201d even mean? Where is Aztl\u00e1n? I had to look it up, and Wikipedia led me into a psychedelic uterus, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ToltecaChichimeca_Chicomostoc.jpg\">the place of the seven caves</a>. It was from this intricate chamber that the ancestors of the Aztecs emerged as a people, and Aztl\u00e1n was the place they settled first, their primordial hometown \u201cfar to the north\u201d where they write of being ruled by a tyrannical elite. But the people who made this myth were travelers, so their longest songs are dedicated to the journey south. Guided by their god, Huitzilopochtli, they received a vision indicating that they would build their city where a certain sign appeared. Though the sign appeared on a tiny, swampy island in the middle of Lake Texcoco, that island became Tenochtitlan\u2014and now Mexico City, the third-largest metropolitan area in the world. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe <i>conquistadores</i> tell the story differently. Even the title of the 1581 book that contains it\u2014<i>The History of the Indies of New Spain</i>\u2014is a kaleidoscopic confusion of imperial desire: \u201cindies,\u201d \u201cNew,\u201d \u201cSpain.\u201d Fray Diego Dur\u00e1n imagines Aztl\u00e1n as an Edenic paradise, free of disease and death. The rhetoric of conquest has a life of its own: soon it became the Aztecs themselves, and later their descendants, who represented the static origin of man in his \u201cstate of nature.\u201d This account denies indigenous people and mestizos access to their own historical past; it disperses their heritage into the ether of prehistory, and drives their own origin myth out of mind. And this kind of cultural repression can have all sorts of long-term consequences for both the repressors and the repressed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the 1970\u2019s,  several groups of Chicano activists called for the establishment of a new homeland for Mexican-Americans in the southwestern United States\u2014California included, naturally. They called it Aztl\u00e1n. Critics of the movement like to call it the \u201cReconquista\u201d\u2014a strange turn of phrase that almost sounds like a confession, if not an apology. The implication is that Mexican immigrants are re-conquering the region that the United States took from Mexico, that their presence is a counter-attack. But \u201cla Conquista\u201d is the official historical term for the Spanish conquest of the Americas. In some ways the word \u201creconquista\u201d implies more than it means to: indeed, if Chicano nationalists are avenging anything, they are avenging the history that links the Spanish empire to the Anglo-American empire\u2014those \u201cpolitical, social, and religious projects that aim at breaking definitively with the past and with human temporality so as to begin absolutely anew, <i>ab ovo</i>, no matter at what cost in material, cultural, and human destruction.\u201d Here the literary critic Geoffrey Hartman is talking about modern European literature, but surely the most monumental example of this phenomenon is the cruel hubris of the words \u201cNew World.\u201d The wild desperation of the colonization of our continents. In resurrecting Aztl\u00e1n as an idea and an aspiration, Chicano activists return us to the origin myths that other empires untold in order to tell their own. They remind us that nations are made through rhetoric. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe American flag does not represent a moment in the history of the nation. It does not represent a distinctive attribute of the landscape. It is not even a riff on the crest or colors of a founding father. The most pervasive myth associated with the flag, as distinct from the Pledge of our childhood, is the myth of its own making\u2014the story of the humble seamstress Betsy Ross abstractly transposing the five-pointed stars and stripes, as though, as Yeats passionately declared, \u201conce out of nature [we] shall never take / [our] bodily form from any natural thing.\u201d No, we would take our form from the imagination. This act is original in its denial of prior origin\u2014neither Betsy Ross nor her design seem so interested in history. The philosopher Jacob Needleman remembers regarding the strange symbol similarly when he was a schoolboy: \r\n<blockquote>\r\nWe were told the flag was sacred, and this caused us to give all of our attention to it. After that, it was really our attention itself that made the flag sacred, far more than the little we knew about its history. . . . stories about the origins and significance of the flag only brought bored smirks to our faces.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nYes, we are told that the stars and stripes represent the states and colonies, but there is something academic in the explanation, since this meaning cannot be communicated by the image itself. Even if it were, the symbolism circles back not to the reason or root of our national being but to the event of national invention, with which the flag is essentially synonymous. Perhaps it is because of this absract quality that the star-spangled banner demands such intense attention. Our anthem is an ode to it, and most schools require us to pay it daily tribute. The Flag Code outlines elaborate rules of conduct in relation to it. And it is, as Needleman remembers, this attention that generates meaning. But even if these rituals generate meaning, the meaning is nothing more than the practice of patriotism, rather than a specific understanding of our patria. Though many words encircle the flag like a barbed-wire halo, they do not describe much more than a pattern of red, white, and blue. If the flag is supposed to say something about who we are as a people, then why does it say so little? \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nNeedleman remembers that \u201cstories about [\u2026] origins and significance [\u2026] only brought bored smirks to our faces.\u201d Any child can see that the flag is not a history lesson. Any child can feel that it means to be forever new. The price of this forever newness is that the unspecific image floats freely, equally at home on a teenager\u2019s bikini or thrust into the ground at Iwo Jima. Behind these bored smirks lurks a profundly American ambivalence as to the place of \u201corigins and significance\u201d in a revolutionary nation. The ease with which Needleman pairs these two terms belies the complex history of their conflation. But in the case of the United States, if significance is to be found at the origin, then our country must contend with the fact that at its root is an uprooting. A revolution. Not only\u2014nor even primarily\u2014a war with the British, but the aggressive denial and systematic devastation of the indigenous peoples of North America. Our flag avoids this reality.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cOne characteristic of the symbol is that it is never wholly arbitrary; it is not empty, for there is the rudiment of a natural bond between the signifier and the signified. The symbol of justice, a pair of scales, could not be replaced by just any other symbol, such as a chariot.\u201d \u2013Ferdinand de Saussure\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe American flag is not a symbol according to this definition. As with words, the signs of language, there is no trace of a natural bond between the signifier and the signified, the image and its meaning. But our flag is a special case. The abstract nature of the stars and stripes, intensified by our attention,  acquires symbolic status, designating the abstract nature of the nation itself. In the eyes of the patriot, this can be euphemistically seen as inventive and revolutionary. Even as the nation\u2019s abiding essence. But what a monumental feat of rhetoric! What a flagrant, flimsy flag to fly! The American flag justifies nothing but invention\u2014not government, not authority, not ownership.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Mexican flag, on the other hand, does seem like a symbol, with its recognizable figures: the eagle, the snake, the cactus, the rock. It is meant to work analogically, to imply that the Mexican nation-state shares certain characteristics with these figures. And much more explicitly, the image is a rendering of the sign the Aztecs saw on their founding journey, the sign that says, yes, build here, yes, this is where you belong. Of course, this recourse to analogy is its own anxiety. It expresses the nation-state\u2019s need to ally itself with something else\u2014with nature and with \u201cnatural man.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI was confused about the meaning of the word radical, so I looked it up in the Oxford English Dictionary:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<a name=\"radical\"></a><b>radical</b>:  <b>1</b>. Of, belonging to, or from a root or roots; fundamental to or inherent in the natural processes of life, vital. <b>2</b>. Relating to or forming the root, basis, or foundation of something; original, primary. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>3 a</b>. Polit. Advocating thorough or far-reaching political or social reform; representing or supporting an extreme section of a party. <b>b</b>. Characterized by independence of or departure from what is usual or traditional; progressive, unorthodox, or innovative in outlook, conception, design, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn Spanish the word is exactly the same, and we find the same schizophrenia. Though reform requires change, and is for this reason a secondary process, it styles itself as a return to the natural way. We want one word for two instincts: the instinct for \u201croots\u201d and the instinct for \u201creform,\u201d the instinct for \u201cfoundation\u201d and the instinct for \u201cdeparture.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>radical: 1.</h3>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFundamental, inherent, original, primary: it is no wonder that institutions so often turn to images of nature when they want to justify themselves. The particular attributes of these natural images are not as important as their naturalness, since their naturalness is not subject to interpretation. It is nature\u2019s mere being that is the envy of the nation-state. Paul de Man describes man\u2019s view of the natural object in his book <i>The Rhetoric of Romanticism</i>, whose applicability here derives from the fact that romanticism as an aesthetic movement coincides with the rise of nationalism and self-determination, in the Old World and in the New. De Man says that \u201cthe natural object, safe in its immediate being, seems to have no beginning and no end. Its permanence is carried by the stability of its being, whereas a beginning implies a negation of permanence, the discontinuity of death. For natural entities like the flower, there is no wavering in the status of their existence.\u201d Because each manifestation of the object\u2014of the flower, of the eagle, and even of the flag itself\u2014does not appear to differ from its previous or subsequent manifestation, it seems to sustain itself in an unbroken chain of being; it seems to achieve a kind of immortality. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe nation-state nurses a deep desire to establish itself as the \u201claw of the land\u201d\u2014an idiom which invokes the \u201claws of nature\u201d and aspires to their inevitablity. We ask, <i>how can we become like the immortal eagle, like the immovable rock?</i> Phrased more strongly, the question takes on a religious resonance: <i>how can we become immortal?</i> Already the turn to the concept of \u201cbecoming,\u201d inevitably linked to the concept of \u201cbeginning,\u201d indicates the futility of the question. If the desirable characteristic of the object is its seeming infinity, then asking how it began truncates that infinity at one end and nullifies that characteristic. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>radical: 3.</h3>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut what are humans, as conscious creatures, to do? We have conscious control over beginning, not originating; making, not being. Political and cultural activity is a movement rather than a state, though the word itself, \u201cstate,\u201d rails against this reality as it clamors to acquire the permanence of the natural object. But for all its elaborate efforts to identify itself with nature, the nation-state does not want to identify itself with nature\u2019s silence and mindlessness, which seems to us like a kind of death. Death becomes a siren that promises ultimate unity, a sort of quiescent and powerful eternity, but demands a high price for the privilege. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere is a threat that hangs over all creative projects, whether poetic or political, and their attempts to install themselves in the natural order: that to succeed in doing so would paradoxically require the sacrifice of their power as conscious beings, the power to intervene, the power to reform. What the nation-state desires is not, precisely, the status of object in its immortal \u201cbeing,\u201d but \u201cbecoming\u201d immortalized. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n(What I desire is not to return to the state of nature prior to the Fall, but to return to the Garden having eaten from the Tree of Knowledge.)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe radicalism of nature runs counter to the radicalism of consciousness, and so we draw near the eagle, snake, cactus, and the rock with a wary eye. They represent immortality\u2014the order to aspire to if we want to last, to be \u201clike gods\u201d\u2014at the same time that they threaten us with immortality\u2019s opposite, the death of consciousness. Political rhetoric does not explicitly respond to this threat; natural objects are almost always praised and paraded as authenticating symbols of the state. The fear of nature\u2019s deathliness is instead an unconscious current that manifests itself more bluntly, in acts of violence towards nature and so-called \u201cnatural man.\u201d These acts of violence enforce hierarchical distance even as the political rhetoric professes unity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/3/curtis.jpg\" class=\"picture\"></center></p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis image is a piece of propoganda. It was produced at a moment when the \u201cIndian question\u201d was at the forefront of American consciousness, and the possible answers proposed by the American government can be starkly phrased as \u201cassimilate or die.\u201d The photographer, Edward Curtis, seems to wistfully choose the second option on behalf of his subjects, titling the image \u201cThe Vanishing Race.\u201d And indeed, he shows the Navajo riders receding darkly into the landscape, hunched and faceless, already at one with the shadows they cast. Only one man looks back, bidding his territory farewell, as though ceding it to the figure of the viewer. You find yourself standing firmly rooted in the place vacated by the riders. Visually, the device is clear: the humanity and significance of the American Indian is reduced by his hazy absorption into the nature. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut here we have a puzzle. There can be no doubt that the conflation of the American Indian and the American landscape is menacing; it is meant to undermine the Indian claim to self-consciousness and self-rule. And yet, at the same time, this conflation is not motivated by scorn for the land, but rather by a rapacious desire for it. Far from dismissing the notion of unity with nature as primitive, the American government yearns towards this unity not only as the precondition for economic success but also as the key to the national character. Frederick Jackson Turner articulates this idea most explicitly in a paper delivered at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893: \u201cThis perennial rebirth, this fluidity of American life, this expansion westward with its new opportunities, <i>its continuous touch with the simplicity of primitive society</i>, furnish the forces dominating American character\u201d (my italics). In other words, the American settler owes his identity to the land and the process of its acquisition, and once it has been acquired, the land serves as his most ennobling symbol and most resplendent reflection.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nParadoxically, we are left to conclude that any kind of mimetic bond with nature degrades the Indian but dignifies the white American. The two symbolic faces of nature, the void and the god, are conveniently split, so that all that is mute, unconscious, and doomed to vanish is associated with the exiled Indian and all that is empowered, eternal, and inevitable is associated with the white race and its political dominion. In an effort to escape the paradox posed by identification with the natural world, Curtis saddles the Navajo riders with the fate of being absorbed by the earth in the white man's place. With a sick sort of graciousness, he ushers the tribe into the sunset as one might usher aging parents, whose genetic contribution can be best enjoyed in their absence. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe spatial ambiguity of the photograph is sophisticated: while on the one hand it positions you so that you are in line with the riders, following in their footsteps and making use of the trail they have cleared, it also sends the riders over the earth's dark rim, so that you find yourself, by contrast, standing still at the bright center of the landscape. You are afforded the luxury of appropriation without identification, both with the American Indian and with nature.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis rhetoric has derived its lasting power in part from the fact that American Indian populations did suffer a precipitous decline in numbers during this period of time, as they were corralled in desolate reservations and subjected to harsh treatment in the \u201cIndian schools\u201d of the West, where children were often taken after being kidnapped from their tribal homes. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBy the numbers, the human cost of conquest was much higher in Mexico than in the United States, but then again, pre-Columbian Mexico was much more densely populated, and the Spanish pursued a program of intermarriage (in addition to the unofficial military program of rape) that resulted in large mestizo populations that often retained\u2014and retain to this day\u2014close linguistic and cultural ties to their indigenous roots. This is not to say that the Indian population has not been consistently undercounted and obfuscated throughout Mexican history. But the sheer numbers of people with strong Indian heritage in Mexico have made their presence impossible to deny, locate unproblematically in the past, or assimilate away. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIndeed, the Mexican flag flies in plain sight, unashamed in its invocation of pre-Columbian history and whatever blood might stain its pages: \u201cecstatic before the cactus with its eagle and its serpent\u2014the happy essence of our country\u2014[the wandering tribe] heard the bird\u2019s prophetic voice promising them refuge on those hospitable lakes.\u201d The Mexican essayist Alfonso Reyes is not alone in his sense of delight in the ancient symbol, nor is he alone in his lack of deeper attention to it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUpon closer historical examination, it becomes clear that very little energy was expended getting the origin story right. Very little energy was spent verifying sources or carefully combing through ruins or tracing oral stories\u2014or if this archaeology was performed, then its findings were not honored. Any cursory journey through the original pictorial codices, paintings, and post-Cortesian Nahuatl manuscripts reveals that while the eagle appears many times in the depiction of the founding of Tenochtitlan\u2014sometimes alone, sometimes devouring another bird, sometimes clutching the Aztec glyph meaning war\u2014the serpent is entirely absent. How, then, do we explain its presence in the coat of arms, which is a symbol intended to authenticate the state and link it to a native tradition?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHistorians now confirm that the serpent was derived from an incorrect translation of the <i>Cr\u00f3nica Mexicayotl</i>. In the Nahuatl text, the words <i>ihuan cohuatl izomocayan</i> mean \u201cthe snake hisses,\u201d but they were mistranslated as \u201cthe snake is torn.\u201d Although the error was detected fairly quickly, the same Diego Dur\u00e1n that Edenized Aztl\u00e1n seized the opportunity to reinterpret the legend according to the European iconographical tradition. The serpent was now associated with sin and the fall of man, and the eagle with nobility and justice. This new interpretation was propagated by means the same <i>History of the Indies of New Spain</i>, published in 1581:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/3/duran.jpg\" class=\"picture\" width=\"500\"><br>An excerpt from Friar Diego Dur\u00e1n's The History of the Indies of New Spain showing the founding of Tenochtitlan.</center></p>\r\n<p>\r\nOf course, the serpent already had a rich iconographical history in the Aztec tradition, particularly in its associations with the god Quetzalcoatl, the patron of priests, and the figure which, according to the chronicles of early <i>conquistadores</i>, was famously associated with Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. Obviously, these associations suggest a wealth of interpretive possibilities, but they were suppressed and subordinated in favor of a Catholic interpretation of the sign. Inadvertently, even this interpretation returns us to the paradoxical purpose of the coat of arms: to return to the eternity of Eden by avenging the expulsion from it, to achieve stability of being through a violent intervention.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDespite this radical mistranslation and reinterpretation, the serpent did not immediately become a canonical element in the Mexican coat of arms. It was not until April of 1823, when the first federal republic was founded and the second national flag adopted, that the serpent appeared in the eagle's right talon. It is almost as though the Constitutional Congress mistook the serpent as a sign of the defeated Spanish Empire, rather than the sign of its triumph. In any case, the inclusion of the serpent is always a willful choice to \u201cimprove upon\u201d the Aztec sign and move the national rhetoric in a new direction. Its very willfulness undermines the naturalizing project of the flag, though as the flag is propagated, fewer and fewer people recognize the innovation. <a href=\"#radical\">Radical 1a</a> eclipses <a href=\"#radical\">radical 3</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nStill, there is an uncomfortable sense in which the flag almost functions as a taunt to contemporary Indians. The <i>Cr\u00f3nica Mexicayotl</i>\u2014its language and its stories\u2014is known well enough that the government could not have expected to completely pass the coat of arms off as the authentic Aztec sign. The government's inclusion of the serpent indicates real disinterest in the details of Indian life, past as well as present. Furthermore, the selection of any sign related to the sign seen on Lake Texcoco refers to a time when the people who would become the Aztecs were not native to the region. Though it certainly can be said to represent the \u201corigin\u201d of Mexico, the sign more literally represents their migrancy and undermines their claim to the earth. It says:  the Aztecs once arrived, made an image, and claimed the land as their own. Now the heirs of the Spanish are doing the same, altering the old image and claiming it as theirs. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThough more coded in its message, the Mexican flag is not so different from the American flag. It also illustrates the impossibility of a definitive origin and the violence required to invent an origin of any kind. Interpreted in this way, it is a lure to the migrants among us. The Mexican flag, hung in windows in my hometown, only occasionally represents loyalty to the nation-state of Mexico. Instead, it represents the perpetual possibility of making Mexico, and the universal liberty to do so: Aztl\u00e1n is where I go. I am Aztl\u00e1n.\r\n <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>There is a venerable literary tradition wherein a protagonist confronts his or her death in order to isolate what really matters to them in life. Tolstoy's <i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</i>, Dicken's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, Ferenc Moln\u00e1r's <i>Liliom</i>, etc. There is also a corresponding filmic tradition which explores the experience of a community confronting its collective demise, usually with far less edifying results. These are the \"Mega Disaster\" films, as distinct from more quotidian disaster films such as \u201cSkyjacked\u201d or \u201cTwister.\u201d Such films have enjoyed enormous popularity, although they have on occasion fallen out of fashion. A paltry number of disaster movies were made in the 1980s, for example, although this was perhaps due to boredom with the typical variety of disaster plots. Indeed, Mega Disasters are of a rather predictable nature, caused by either one very large attacking animal (\u201cGodzilla,\u201d \u201cKing Kong\u201d), a horde of more reasonably sized attacking animals (\u201cThe War of the Worlds,\u201d \u201cThe Swarm\u201d), nuclear holocaust (\u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d), or a threatening rock (\u201cArmageddon\u201d).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In the mid-\u201890s, however, the genre returned with the visible success of two films: \u201cIndependence Day\u201d (1996) and \u201cJurassic Park\u201d (1993). While neither of these movies invented a new efficient cause for mayhem\u2014they are both of the \u201chorde of reasonably sized attacking animal\u201d variety\u2014they did innovate in critical ways besides simply having good special effects. \u201cIndependence Day\u201d demonstrated that movie audiences were hungry for more Mega in their Mega-Disaster films; the American public was ready to witness the apocalypse.<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup> Meanwhile \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d playing on then prevalent concerns about genetic engineering, successfully tied the news of the times to disaster without mentioning the word \u201cradiation.\u201d The legacies of these two films were synthesized in the 2000s, when a series of films raised the possibility of human extinction at the hands of a wrathful mother nature. In this essay I would like to scrutinize this genre, which is exemplified by five films: \u201cThe Day After Tomorrow\u201d (2004), \u201cThe Happening\u201d (2008), \u201c2012\u201d (2009), \u201cSunshine\u201d (2007), and \u201cThe Core\u201d (2003). I want to pose the question, \u201cWhat is it that we really learn by vicariously experiencing the world\u2019s demise?\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Before taking up that question properly, however, I think it is probably necessary to defend taking the genre seriously in the first place. After all, it is impossible to dispute that these movies are made to be enjoyed by the moviegoing public\u2019s lowest common denominator. These are films for those short on attention and long on ignorance. These are motion pictures for folks who don\u2019t get emotional over mixed metaphors; people that like it kept stupid, simple. It almost seems to be a requirement that the science behind the mega disaster be ludicrous (e.g. \u201c2012,\u201d wherein neutrinos superheat the earth\u2019s core, causing its crust to melt). Moreover, the direction that the scenarios lead often presumes an appalling lack of common sense. At one point in \u201cThe Core,\u201d someone actually manages to breathe inside the center of the earth. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Even though these films do not cater to those with any degree of sophistication, they do, for whatever reason, always contain a quite explicit political agenda. \u201cThe Day After Tomorrow,\u201d for example, features thinly veiled take-offs of George Bush and Dick Cheney getting their comeuppance for denying global warming. The satire is a bit more subtle in \u201cThe Happening,\u201d which is about trees fighting back against deforestation. Strewn throughout these films are references to mass human suffering around the world, a connection between the fearsome imagery they contain and the concrete political situation in the present. These films have a satirical side, which cannot be ignored simply because the scenarios presented are so ludicrous. They are all responding to contemporary issues, either in a sophisticated way (\u201c<i>The Happening</i> is a mainstream attempt to scare people into realizing the potentially disastrous effects of ecological encroachment,\u201d according to critic Joseph Foy) or one just a smidge less so (\u201cSo we thought, \u2018Let's do that,\u2019 because everybody's focusing on global warming and stuff like that. The fear is that everything is heating up\u2014let's go the other way, flip it, and make a film about global freezing\u2026if Sydney's frozen, you know the planet's in a bit of trouble,\u201d <a href=\"http://movies.ign.com/articles/772/772907p1.html\">according to the director</a>). Given the immensity of the audience these films have, it is important to think about what that audience is hearing. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Which is, now, exactly what? Surprisingly, most of the \u201cwrathful nature\u201d films do not explicitly raise environmental politics; only \u201cThe Happening\u201d and \u201cThe Day After Tomorrow\u201d actually attempt to portray the disastrous effects of pollution. \u201cThe Core\u201d critiques the military-industrial complex. Meanwhile \u201c2012\u201d portrays a major issue in all disaster relief efforts: how does one decide who and what gets spared? The point made in \u201c2012\u201d is a good one, that the rich and powerful will essentially be inured from the consequences of most disasters. Moreover, this is a glaring injustice that will become more and more relevant as the effects of global warming continue to grow: the world\u2019s poorest, who have done the least to create the problems of global warming, who reap the fewest rewards of industrialization, will also suffer its consequences the most. Still, it\u2019s clear that the disaster that happens in \u201c2012\u201d would have happened no matter what environmental policies were adopted, making eco-politics functionally irrelevant.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Although these films may not necessarily mention environmental issues explicitly, they really are about humanity\u2019s relationship to nature. The defining characteristic of these movies is that they all exhibit cities being destroyed, not by rampaging monsters, but rather by forces that are not normally considered to have anything resembling agency: water, lava, lightning, pollen, neutrinos. The question of why civilization is being destroyed by these impersonal forces is asked at some point in most of the films, but the answer hardly seems to matter. There are several cynical explanations for why these films fail to explain the reasons behind their disasters. Perhaps broaching the subject would force the films to confront the science behind the disaster, a lose-lose opportunity from the filmmaker\u2019s perspective: audience members who might be interested in the science wouldn\u2019t buy it, while those who are not interested in the science would simply be bored.  Or more simply, perhaps the decision to skip the whys has something to do with the fact that no one in the audience really has any interest in seeing people discuss any subject at all for a protracted length of time. Note how <a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/2012.html\">it takes 14 pages before \u201c2012\u201d has more than 6 lines of consecutive dialogue</a>. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>It is, however, possible to give a more charitable explanation for why the films do not, in general, try to explain why the events are happening. Namely, it is understood that the effects of the disaster are going to happen no matter what, so nothing dramatic hinges on the answer to why it is happening. Indeed, the only one of these five films that actually does ask why at any length, \u201cThe Happening,\u201d is able to do so because the exact nature of the disaster remains murky for most of the film. The murkiness of the disaster leads to a situation where the characters\u2019 survival depends on actually figuring out what\u2019s happening. When Mark Wahlberg does determine what is actually going on, the why swiftly disappears as a concern from the film. There is nothing for Wahlberg to do for people in general; there is only the opportunity to save himself and those close to him. Indeed, in all of these films, the immensity of the disasters seems to dwarf the capacity of the protagonists for action. Everyone in these films simply has to focus on doing the best he or she can, and leave the big questions for later. By depriving the characters the time or inclination to ask why, the films heighten the sense of helplessness that the characters feel in the face of the disaster.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>This is where the explicit agenda of these films connects to the subject matter they portray: they are both about human beings, as well as humanity in general, being helpless, small, and fragile. Scientists dabbling with what they know not (\u201cThe Core,\u201d \u201cSunshine\u201d), industrialists run amok (\u201cThe Happening,\u201d \u201cThe Day After Tomorrow\u201d), humanity unwittingly close to its own demise (\u201c2012\u201d): the common theme is human hubris, and the fall that follows is supposed to be a more accurate re-estimation of humanity\u2019s real worth.<sup><a name=\"id2\" href=\"#ft2\">2</a></sup> At one point in \u201cThe Happening,\u201d while Mark Wahlberg\u2019s character is fleeing through a post-apocalyptic New Jersey, the audience is presented with a prominent advertisement for a new McMansion development. The advertisement reads, \u201cBecause you deserve it,\u201d a fitting explanation for the mayhem itself. In \u201c2012,\u201d a character issues what might easily be read as a broad indictment of contemporary society, \u201cCivilization means to work together to create a better life\u2026 there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here.\u201d Indeed, these films often present a stunning condemnation of humanity. They bring into focus humanity\u2019s limitations, our frailty, and our wickedness in the face of our certain destruction.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Or, that\u2019s what these films would do, were it not for the fact that, without exception, it turns out that the certain Armageddon proposed was not so sure after all. The apocalypse never actually happens in any of these movies. All the protagonists positioned to earn our affection survive not much the worse for wear. Civilization continues much the same as it did before. Indeed, these films are not actually about humanity confronting its frailty, but rather about humanity rising to face challenges never before confronted. It\u2019s Humanism, the celebration of humanity and human potential, that these films preach, not anti-Humanism, the derision of humanity and the nay-saying on our race. In fact, as a rule, anti-Humanists are mocked in the film, as for example Woody Harrelson\u2019s character in \u201c2012,\u201d whose only character description in the screenplay is as a 62-year-old \u201ccrazy looking guy with binoculars around his neck.\u201d This character is the only one who is enthused about the prospect of apocalypse (\u201cYou'll never make it out in time. Just stay and enjoy the big bang!\u201d), and he is crushed to death by a hurtling molten rock. Or, if the naysayers aren\u2019t mocked, they\u2019re reviled, as in \u201cSunshine,\u201d where a crazed sun-worshipping astronaut ends up destroying two spaceships because he believes that the ships will interfere with the God\u2019s/the Sun\u2019s intent to destroy mankind. The astronaut is portrayed less as a human being and more as a clever, fast, and malicious zombie.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>It\u2019s clear in these films that you do not want to be against Humanity. Rather, the point these films demonstrate is that if you\u2019re resourceful, like the protagonists, and don\u2019t give up hope or go crazy, then you can brave all the odds and actually survive that which cannot be survived. It\u2019s not necessary to have made any preparations, and you don\u2019t need connections to wealth or power: all you need is ingenuity and you\u2019ll be able to avoid the pathetic, humorous death faced by the overwhelming majority.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In short, these films really encourage the public not to worry about the possibility of massive environmental danger; someone else will figure out how to deal with the problem. And even though a lot of people might die, each individual audience member will, like John Cusack or Dennis Quaid or whatever protagonist the audience member identifies with, probably be able to look after himself and all the people he cares about. We\u2019re encouraged, in the end, to believe that each of us is somehow one of those destined to be spared from the disaster. Far from encouraging us to be more prudent in the face of our current challenges, films in the avenging earth genre induce complacency. Insofar as this is the case, these are some of the most hypocritical films Hollywood has ever produced. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\"><p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nIn order to find an American blockbuster prior to Independence that presented a comparable disaster, one <a href=\"http://www.filmsite.org/disasterfilms.html\">needs to go back</a> 17 years to 1979\u2019s Meteor.\r\n</p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft2\" href=\"#id2\">2</a></sup>\r\nSunshine makes the point most unsubtly by christening the space ship sent to reignite the sun \u201cIcarus.\u201d Why humanity would jinx its last hope for survival by associating it with a man who flew close to the sun and died is anyone\u2019s guess. </p>\r\n\r\n</div>",

Its water is the water of the Hooghly, and its air is dirt. \r\n</p><p>\r\n      [\u2026] \r\n</p><p>\r\n      A cab-driver volunteered to show me the glory of the town for so much an hour, and with him I wandered far. He conceived that all this turmoil and squash was a thing to be reverently admired, that it was good to huddle men together in fifteen layers, one atop of the other, and to dig holes in the ground for offices.  \r\n</p><p>\r\n      He said that Chicago was a live town, and that all the creatures hurrying by me were engaged in business. That is to say they were trying to make some money that they might not die through lack of food to put into their bellies. He took me to canals as black as ink, and filled with un-told abominations, and bid me watch the stream of traffic across the bridges. \r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe horrified Kipling wanders through the unnaturally straight streets, the sun blocked out by proto-skyscrapers. To Kipling, with his well-established love of the natural world, a \u201creal city\u201d is an abomination. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe character of cities has changed a great deal since Kipling\u2019s time, and the negative perception of cities has softened as technology and society have progressed. Although the idea that cities are somehow unnatural lingers, we are shifting away from a dichotomy between cities and nature. Previously it was thought, if cities and their ailments are unnatural, it stands to reason that nature can be used to treat urban problems. This idea has a long history, but it was the soot-covered cities of the Industrial Revolution that intensified the contrast between city and countryside and the accompanying efforts to bring nature into the cities.  Today our society is beginning to understand that cities exist within nature, rather than opposed to it. I want to examine two examples of nature-based solutions to urban problems in particular\u2014the enormously influential Garden City movement of a century ago, which saw the city and nature as adversaries, and the present-day push for urban agriculture as a way to fix Rust Belt cities like Detroit, which is not based on a binary view of the city and nature. \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Garden City movement was founded by a London clerk named Ebenezer Howard in the last years of the nineteenth century. As a young man, Howard had traveled to the United States in 1871. In Nebraska he pursued and quickly abandoned his ambition of becoming a farmer. From there he traveled first to Chicago for a stint as a reporter and finally back to London in 1876, but not before being introduced to American transcendentalism. He published his one and only book, <i>To-morrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform</i> (later renamed <i>Garden Cities of To-morrow</i>) in 1898, a book that changed the course of a century of urban planning. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough Howard presents his Garden City as a solution to the problems of the country as much as those of the city, it was the crisis of cities he was responding to. Howard saw cities like London or the industrial towns of northern England as overcrowded and miserable places for many of their residents. The memory of the devastating cholera epidemics that swept nineteenth-century cities lingered, and debtors\u2019 prisons and public parks were crowded with the urban poor. The countryside was poor too, of course, but the countryside seemed to offer poverty with dignity. Too many in the cities were preoccupied with money and commerce. Howard believed he could design a city around the bucolic virtues and eliminate the terrible disorders of the city. He writes, \r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n      The country is the symbol of God\u2019s love and care for man. All that we are and all that we have comes from it [...] Its beauty is the inspiration of art, of music, of poetry. Its forces propel all the wheels of industry. It is the source of all health, all wealth, all knowledge. But its fullness of joy and wisdom has not revealed itself to man. Nor can it ever, so long as this unholy, unnatural separation of society and nature endures.  \r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe proposed town of 30,000 residents features concentric circles with specialized uses intersected by six spoke-like boulevards. The very center of the town contains a five-acre garden which is then surrounded by municipal and cultural institutions (e.g. the town hall, museums, the theater). The next ring contains a great park which would include several crystal palaces to serve as marketplaces and winter gardens. Beyond that is the rest of town with dense but spacious housing, a circumferential boulevard, and, on the edge of town, a thin band of workshops and small factories. Finally, the town is surrounded with orchards, pastures, and a variety of other agricultural land, all producing goods primarily for the town.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/3/ellis.jpg\" class=\"picture\" width=500></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHoward spends most of <i>Garden Cities</i> on practical and somewhat mundane considerations\u2014the generation of revenue, the mechanisms of administration, and so on\u2014but there is a moral objective to his plan. Howard believed that the natural environment of Garden City would encourage a moral society, even to the extent that it could lead heavy drinkers away from the bottle without having to ban alcohol outright. If the Garden City could keep town and country harmoniously balanced, then society would be too. The Garden City is a city in a vacuum, always in equilibrium and rarely affected by outside forces. It was the dynamism and unpredictability of cities that alarmed Howard, who made the mistake of associating the unchanging character of rural communities with nature. Once a Garden City is established, it is static. There is no opportunity to advance within society, no latitude within the plan for innovation or adaptation to unforeseen technologies, and commerce on a scale beyond local is virtually impossible.   \r\n</p><p>\r\nWithin a decade two Garden Cities were in the works outside of London, and the following years saw Howard\u2019s Garden City ideas applied in Germany, the United States, and in the plan for Australia\u2019s new capital city, Canberra. The Garden City plans being realized were rapidly diverging from Howard\u2019s vision of small, self-sustaining Garden Cities into garden suburbs, particularly in the United States. The garden suburb kept the bucolic trappings of Howard\u2019s garden cities, but abandoned the more radical notions of self-sustainability and egalitarianism. Even \u201cproper\u201d Garden Cities were deeply flawed. Canberra is perhaps the world\u2019s most vibrant Garden City, but for its first forty years it was a stagnant, isolated town. A 1954 Australian government study found that administrators saw the city as \u201can expensive housing scheme for public servants.\u201d It was only when the authorities allowed the rigid plan of the city to break down in the 1950s, allowing for changes in lifestyle and technology, that the city began to thrive, and the population jumped from around 25,000 in 1950 to around 350,000 today. In the example of Canberra we can see the Garden City\u2019s greatest flaw\u2014both cities and nature, whether antithetical or not, are dynamic entities, but there\u2019s no room for change in Howard\u2019s plan.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Garden City idea doesn\u2019t ever seem to go away, in part, I think, because we can\u2019t get over this idea that cities lack nature. A more accurate way of looking at it might be that cities don\u2019t utilize nature properly. Ironically the Garden City movement (or what it\u2019s become) has gone a long way towards suppressing nature in its encouragement of sprawl.  \r\n</p><p>\r\nToday the sustainability movement continues to pick up momentum, and although its objectives are ultimately global in scale, many of its solutions purport to solve problems on a local level. Ebenezer Howard was tackling the problem of overcrowded cities, but Detroit is facing the opposite problem. Detroit has become something of a \u201cruin porn\u201d star, with photojournalists flocking to the depressed city to snap photos of collapsing concert halls and neighborhoods being reclaimed by prairie. In a sense, nature is doing a pretty good job at, in the words of the conservationist George Perkins Marsh, \u201creclaiming lands laid waste by human improvidence.\" Since the city began declining fifty years ago, dozens of solutions for revitalization have been proposed and a few of them implemented, from the mixed-use Renaissance Center to the People Mover. One of the most recent fixes is a push to turn the city\u2019s 200,000 vacant lots into farmland.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nDetroit\u2019s urban agriculture movement has generated <a href=\"http://www.grist.org/article/food-from-motown-to-growtown-the-greening-of-detroit\">plenty</a> of <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2009/12/29/news/economy/farming_detroit.fortune/index.htm\">national</a> <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBQQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democracynow.org%2F2010%2F6%2F24%2Fdetroit_urban_agriculture_movement_looks_to&ei=HA-pTc_oLYeksQOBv4j5DA&usg=AFQjCNHJokDQuOq_YF9P8t5dhMwwW5gABw&sig2=aY9uC8BsUa7FUpkDpzi\">excitement</a>, and it\u2019s hard not to be excited. Taken together, the literature makes urban farming sound like Detroit\u2019s silver bullet. By turning the blighted urban space into productive agricultural space the farms promise to create jobs for the city\u2019s nearly 140,000 unemployed, provide healthy produce to the city\u2019s vast food deserts, generate clean air and water, free up millions of dollars in municipal services and boost the local tourism industry. And there\u2019s a moral argument here, too, that nature in the form of urban farming can foster community cohesion and empower residents to take more control over their own lives.  A line from the mission statement of Earthworks Urban Farm in Detroit echoes Howard (and many others) when it says, \r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n      As a society, we have become dangerously disconnected from the land and the sources of food that sustain life. We have detached ourselves from the real source of wealth - a respectful and reverent relationship with each other and the land. \r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nIt might seem paradoxical that Detroit\u2019s return to nature is supposed to halt urban decay, but only if you accept that the city is antithetical to nature. If instead you see urban farming as a way to harness the nature already present within the city, it becomes clearer what separates this plan from the Garden Cities. When presented as opposites, the city overpowers nature or nature overpowers the city. Howard\u2019s search for an equilibrium resulted in a model of urban stasis. For Detroit\u2019s urban farmers, nature exists within the city and vice versa. This more nuanced approach to treating urban problems with nature will surely prove more successful at revitalizing the city. \r\n <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nThe fall into sin and the exile from paradise are woven into the structural fabric of the biblical myth of Eden more clearly than they are demonstrated by its narrative content. The creation story is told in two different ways in subsequent chapters in the Bible. The first version in chapters one and two creates the human as two equivalent entities&mdash;or perhaps one androgynous entity&mdash;and does not include the myth of paradise or the theme of exile. The second version in chapters two and three, which situates the creation of the human being within paradise, is the one which tells of the woman being shaped out of the form of the man as an assistant and a partner to him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe two once lived as a single entity. It was only following the creature&rsquo;s obvious alienation from each of its fellows that it was sundered into two. This initial rearrangement of the coordinates of selfhood&mdash;an estrangement from wholeness of being&mdash;was in fact the fall. Serious enough that the text itself is sundered into two as well, an act of self-mutilation designed to distract from the facts at its center. The narrative stops and begins again with a retroactively remade human subjectivity, which erases the being&rsquo;s wholeness from its memory. This disjunction, both back-in-time and within-to-without itself, makes it impossible to imagine anything but a fall into sin. The imbalance of powers etched into our self-conscious&mdash;one primary being and one being as his helper&mdash;is the necessary pre-condition as well as the reinforced consequences of the fall.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is what is meant by the following midrash:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhy is it that the snake attacks the woman and not the man? Because the man was sleepy from screwing and was taking a nap (Genesis Rabbah 19.3, paraphrased). Even before either being had eaten from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, they had already discovered how to convert their togetherness into solitude.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFabrics and words were once recognized as identical. Which is an admittedly fanciful way of saying that texts and textiles are of common etymological origin (L. <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/texo#Latin\">tex\u014d</a>=weave). The Hebrew language shares this conceptual association in the word masekhes, which means both &lsquo;weave&rsquo; and &lsquo;talmudic tractate.&rsquo; What is the common thread that holds together our words and our clothing? Both are constructed and both construct. They articulate at the same time that they obscure. Living today in a world that is textually thicker than ever before, it may be worthwhile to return to this concept.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe driving force of the myth of paradise is the garment of mistrust and self-deception that clothes the naked indulgence of the act. Clothing is a physical instantiation of these words of trickery. That is, the need for clothing is the culmination of a failure to act honestly or in accordance with one&rsquo;s words.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n1. Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman: &lsquo;Yea, hath God said: Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?&rsquo;\r\n</blockquote>\r\nWhy is it that the imaginative faculty is called &lsquo;snake&rsquo;?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSome (Sforno) say it is because his presence is imperceptible, but the damage that he wreaks is fatal.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOthers (Dr. Devora Steinmetz) say it is because he encircles the truth with his words.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSome (Radak) say they knew nothing of sex, that nothing distracted them from the will of their creator.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOthers (Sforno)  say they did not know the shame of sex, or that sex for them was always awesome, never deleterious or excessive.\r\nIn many cases, sex becomes a metaphor for knowledge. The eyes and the heart are pimps for sin (Palestinian Talmud Berakhos 1:8).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA question is often raised regarding the paradox of moral judgment: How can they have committed evil before they know anything of either good or evil? The sad fact that is seen and mourned by Augustine most desperately is that the dawning of moral knowledge is always preceded by rotten moral decisions (and not vice versa). Every one of us is outside the garden before we know it.\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n2 And the woman said unto the serpent: &lsquo;Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.&rsquo;\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nWhy does the woman never refer to the tree by its name? Because she doesn&rsquo;t know what it does at all. No one told her. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThere are those who would argue that the tree of knowledge and the tree of life are the same tree. It is clear in any case that the woman would not have known the difference, since she was introduced to nothing but the form of interdiction. &ldquo;Do not eat of this,&rdquo; she is told; the referent and the rationale are omitted while the interdiction is preserved.\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n4 And the serpent said unto the woman: &lsquo;Ye shall not surely die; 5 for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.&rsquo;\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThe snake acts on the presumption that the woman will never admit to her confusion. She masks her uncertainty with false certainty, reasserts the notion of the form of a rule with a rule of her own creation (&ldquo;and do not touch it,&rdquo; Gen 3.3).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThis erasure and compensatory redrawing troubles us. It is the central mythic gesture of the text, one we see repeated everywhere we look. The continuous reinvention of the Jewish tradition uses this gesture as the guiding rule for its persistence: we have forgotten the boundary, how it exactly was, it says. Let&rsquo;s not apologize too much; meanwhile we must remake the boundaries ourselves. Many today will recognize this moment of hesitation and regenerated certainty from their own struggles at asserting some kind of personhood. The woman knows very little of what she was, only what she is. This dizzying array of rules and rationalizations is too much for her; she experiences the kind of rush in the head that comes from the disorienting experience of a forcefully implanted identity. In this case the snake is an avatar of God; they are both playing the same game. One interdicts, the other contradicts; one is an act of creation and one is an act of entrapment, but both acts collude to complete the other.\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat. \r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThe main operative forces in this tale are the demon powers jealousy and lies. Leo Strauss, in his essay &ldquo;Jerusalem and Athens: Some Preliminary Reflections,&rdquo; wavers between the argument that they ate of the tree out of forgetfulness, and that they failed to eat of the tree of life because they were singularly obsessed with the prohibition on the tree of knowledge. The cumulative corrosive effects of deception take the paradoxical form delineated accidentally by Strauss of at once drifting from prohibition and being unceasingly obsessed by it&mdash;which means effectively that you can convince even yourself that an object of desire is of no concern to you, that you are drifting with regard to it, when of course you are drifting straight towards it. This posture of unconcern allows the man to omit crucial information in instructing the woman, allows the woman to act alone and to justify her action as inconsequential, and allows the man in turn to eat the fruit without concern for it.\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\nThe violation of the tree was merely the very first of countless external symptoms of the fundamental disease of human interaction. There was no metaphysical transformation of the human being upon their consumption of its fruit; there was nothing in the fruit itself which opened their eyes.\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves girdles.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThe tree simply stands for the moment of horrifying exposure when the man and woman see their actions unadorned and unexplained. That moment of naked truth is why they open their eyes to themselves and to their irreversible failures. That is why they need, all of a sudden, to clothe themselves.\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden toward the cool of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. 9 And the LORD God called unto the man, and said unto him: &lsquo;Where art thou?&rsquo; 10 And he said: &lsquo;I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.&rsquo;\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nAll might thus admit that the fall of man is neither in the transgression nor the acquisition of knowledge but in averting our eyes after the fact, in hiding in the bushes from our actions.\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n22 And the LORD God said: &lsquo;Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.&rsquo; 23 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 24 So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way to the tree of life. \r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nEither paradise exists somewhere outside us and we cannot find it, or it exists somewhere inside us and we cannot expunge it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDid the animals get banished from paradise? Not stated. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nKafka had it backwards on this point when he said, &ldquo;Our destiny has been altered; that this has also happened with the destiny of Paradise is not stated.&rdquo; We have stayed exactly where we are; it is paradise that has changed. A world that once cleaved to us now shrinks away from us like dead skin (cf. Gen 3.17). Paradise is the concept that exists as a foil for our feelings of unmitigated estrangement from our world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nParadise is not unlike <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2071319/Fake-bus-stop-keeps-Alzheimers-patients-from-wandering-off.html\">the famous bus stop outside the home for the senile in D\u00fcsseldorf</a>. It is the outpost at the limits of our fetters, where an escape from ourselves is concomitant with a return to our self. Paradise is the ultimate conflation of a bus stop with the place you're trying to go. Paradise, like the bus stop, relies on the inertial confusion of its senile escapees, who as soon as they find themselves in motion are content to stop again, to wait for something new to happen. Both are short-circuits installed into an escape route, bringing it right back to where it began. Paradise presents itself as the telos of our desire, as a place where one could stop to rest before having gotten anywhere.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOur visible world is the condensation of countless paradises. One paradise transforms your experience into weightless delight. An entire living world is the accumulation of all of them in a circle around you. Why is it that Paradise is called a snake? Because it swallows its prey whole after immobilizing it by brute force. \r\n <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<blockquote>\u201cOh perfect beauty of a sunflower!\u201d \u2013 Allen Ginsberg, Sunflower Sutra</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\u201cTrees! How ghastly!\u201d \u2013 Piet Mondrian, reportedly, upon gazing out of an apartment window</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPiet Mondrian, Charmion von Wiegand tells us, had such a \u201cgeneral revulsion against green and growth [that] when seated at a table beside a window through which trees were visible, [he would] persuade someone to switch places.\u201d Indeed, Mondrian\u2019s aversion to the color is so noticeable that the minimalist artist Dan Flavin dedicated \u201c<a href=\"http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/piece/?search=dan%20flavin&page=1&f=quicksearch&cr=2\">Greens Crossing Greens</a>\u201d to him. But given his belief in the supremacy of city life, Mondrian\u2019s choice of colors and aversion to nature is not surprising. After all, Mondrian developed his artistic philosophy at a time when the contrast between cities and the natural environment was heavily discussed, when the city was ascendant\u2014in commerce, society, and art. In this context, Mondrian\u2019s trajectory is emblematic of the influence of the city on visual art\u2019s path towards abstraction.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn contrast to the art of previous epochs, much of modern art has been distinctly urban; this change can be attributed to the Industrial Revolution and the rise of the bourgeoisie. Artists were no strangers to cities, and the emergence of wealthy urban art purchasers and museums shortened the distance between them and their patrons. As art was increasingly produced by urban artists, for urban consumers, the city became not only a motif in art, but an ideology. This ideology preached formal innovation and the importance of progress, and favored the manmade over the natural sublime. This tendency to link art to the city both stylistically and formally is most visible in the work of Mondrian, but it is also present in many of the major abstract artists of the 20th century, especially those who called New York home. After all, artists ultimately draw inspiration from what they can see\u2014and what the New York artists were seeing on a day-to-day basis was walls of buildings and the throng of humanity. The development of abstract art, which de-emphasized natural beauty, was the ultimate product of the ascendance of an urban aesthetic.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhy were artists drawn to the city as their subject? Because it was what they knew, and the methods they had developed seemed best suited to city life. But to some degree it was a chance combination of artistic and economic trends. Artists lived in the city, their audiences and buyers increasingly lived in the city, and so it seemed natural to make work that could speak to urban audiences and champion the urban lifestyle. Minimalist painter Frank Stella stated: \u201cA thing that I can see in a lot of my paintings is that they seem obviously to relate to a kind of urban situation almost or urban landscape, and there\u2019s something about my paintings and the way that they\u2019re done which just seems to relate to city life\u2026 A lot has specifically some of the quality of New York or something.\u201d Sounding a cautionary note, Stella continued: \u201cI don\u2019t know that that\u2019s a good idea; in the beginning I couldn\u2019t avoid it and I don\u2019t even try to avoid it now, but I think that it could be limiting in a way.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nOver time, the city came to shape both the form and content of its art, but when it first appeared in the art of the 19th century, the urban landscape seemed to promise artistic freedom and new vistas for expression. The Impressionists were the first artists to turn their easels back towards the city, after a century populated mostly by historical works and country idylls. While the work that sparked Impressionism, Manet\u2019s \u201cLe d\u00e9jeuner sur l&rsquo;herbe\u201d (\u201cThe Luncheon on the Grass\u201d), did not explicitly reference the city, it turned the attention of art back towards scenes of everyday life.  Other paintings would capture glimpses of the beautiful in the artist\u2019s daily round: views of harbor sunsets, cathedrals, parks, and salons.  Impressionism quickly became popular among Paris salon-dwellers who valued innovation, novelty, and the cosmopolitan lifestyle, and who were socially connected to the city\u2019s art scene. The artistic class, which had always resided in the city, relished this freedom from drawing Perseus and alpine ruins, and fixed its eyes on city life.  But Impressionism did not aim at moving beyond moments of beauty it found in the urban lifestyle.  It would take another movement, Cubism, to incorporate the dynamism and disorder of city life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe analytic Cubists took a sharp step towards abstraction, and in the process focused specifically on the urban experience. While the Impressionists painted pleasant views from fixed vantage points, the Cubists conveyed the constant motion, chaos, and alienation of the urban landscape. They began to take apart the visual terrain of urban life, abstracting it into geometric shapes that at the same time identified multiple perspectives on an object and the bewilderment of urban living. The monochrome color palate of early Cubist works often makes them seem gritty and confrontational. While the Impressionists derived their content from the urban landscape, the Cubists embraced its formal implications. Their paintings had a way of alienating viewers, yet there was something comforting in the occasional identification of familiar objects.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPiet Mondrian&rsquo;s early artistic trajectory paralleled the artistic movements engulfing Paris and Europe at the time. His early painting was influenced by Impressionism and the Fauvist emphasis on color. In 1911, he encountered Cubism at a gallery in Amsterdam and moved to Paris to be closer to that scene. But after a brief Cubist period featuring a few highly abstract and terrifying pictures of trees, he moved wholly towards geometrical abstraction and developed an artistic philosophy, \u201cNeoplasticism,\u201d that emphasized non-representational harmony. Regarding his Impressionist and Cubist periods, Piet Mondrian would state: \u201cGradually I became aware that Cubism did not accept the logical consequences of its own discoveries.\u201d Cubists clung to representation even while disassembling their subjects; Mondrian would try to move beyond this approach to an art that dispensed entirely with the natural world. Living in a series of cities\u2014Paris, Amsterdam, Paris, New York\u2014Mondrian would produce abstract works that he felt captured both the liveliness and order of city life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMondrian split with previous traditions by focusing entirely on the relations between geometric shapes, harmoniously arranging rectangles and lines on a canvas. Whereas Analytic Cubism broke everyday objects into geometric fragments to convey subjectivity, Mondrian\u2019s Neoplasticism claimed that there was an abstract, pure beauty contrasting with and superior to representation. \u201cThe cultivated man of today,\u201d he claimed, \u201cis gradually turning away from natural things, and his life is becoming ever more abstract.\u201d This level of abstraction emphasized the entire visual experience, and associated itself more closely with architecture and urban life. Mondrian argued that by generating abstractions linked to city life, he would allow viewers to come into harmony with their everyday existence. This is not to say that Mondrian saw existence as bare and colorless\u2014his last works attest to his love of jazz and swing rhythms\u2014but that he believed a deeper harmony operated below the activity of the city.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/3/composition_london.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br>Mondrian, <i>Composition London</i></center></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nI might make a brief detour here into my own opinions on the matter of visual harmony with the urban terrain. To be frank, I think an urban environment conflicts in many ways with our aesthetics. Consider that the geometric elements of the city\u2014lines and blocks\u2014are nowhere to be found outside of human artifice. Certainly attempts have been made to describe the city as beautiful and sublime, but they ultimately fall short of making the city a compelling alternative to nature. Abstract art, to some degree, was an assault on natural beauty, a fact acknowledged by Mondrian but often lost by later artists. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMondrian believed that abstract beauty was superior to natural beauty. He claimed that if you depict nature you must include \u201cwhatever is capricious and twisted in nature.\u201d In this respect, he was fairly radical, but he heralded the direction of art to come. Natural beauty contains emotional components that distract from visual harmony and order. Mondrian wrote:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cIf you follow nature you will not be able to vanquish the tragic to any real degree in your art. It is certainly true that naturalistic painting makes us feel a harmony which is beyond the tragic, but it does not express this in a clear and definite way, since it is not confined to expressing relations of equilibrium. Let us recognize the fact once and for all: the natural appearance, natural form, natural color, natural rhythm, natural relations most often express the tragic . . . We must free ourselves from our attachment to the external, for only then do we transcend the tragic, and are enabled consciously to contemplate the repose which is within all things.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHarmony, in other words, can only be found when painting is stripped of representation. The cycles of life and death in the natural world lend it its beauty, but distract from the \u201cpure\u201d beauty present in lines and elementary shapes\u2014shapes that dominated cityscapes. For Mondrian, this meant that the harmony one could feel with the city was fundamentally different and superior to that of the country.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis claim is what I meant when I stated that modern art is ideologically aligned with city life. While we tend to think of abstraction as divorced from representation, the harmonies in abstract art take as their basis the artist&rsquo;s everyday environment. This tendency was particularly visible in the minimalist artists after Mondrian who lived in cities. Their visual harmonies were often dominated by crisp lines, sharp angles, and other products of artificial existence and urban architecture. A generation of artists such as Stella, Donald Judd, and Sol Lewitt generated works that were not representational but nevertheless very urban. The cause was not, as Mondrian claimed, that abstraction and the city were intertwined. Rather, the artists based their abstraction on the urban landscape that surrounded them, producing works marked by linearity and duplication.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/3/sky_above_clouds.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br>Georgia O&rsquo;Keefe, <i>Sky Above Clouds</i></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe exception that proves the rule is Georgia O&rsquo;Keeffe, probably the most well-known natural artist in American art. Her early works focused mostly on city scenes, and particularly New York&rsquo;s skyscrapers, and her painting style sometimes gave even those elements of the city an expressiveness not present in the art of many of her pre-war contemporaries. But after settling in New Mexico in 1929, her art changed dramatically. Her color palette became more vibrant, her shapes less geometric, and she focused on flowers, skulls, skies, and the desert landscape. Her most famous abstract works were inspired by extreme close-ups of flowers and the shape of the landscape and sky. OKeeffe&rsquo;s urban works were vibrant in their own right, but her artistic vision widened when she moved from the city. That is perhaps the clearest consequence of art&rsquo;s urban orientation\u2014the curtailment of visions and perspectives that do not mesh with urban existence. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAccording to Mondrian, art is an essential means for coming into harmony with our surroundings. Given that we are entering the first decade in which the majority of the world lives in cities, it is more essential than ever to create art that cures our alienation from the urban environment. While Mondrian&rsquo;s disavowal of nature was fairly extreme, city-dwellers should heed his goal of imbuing life with harmony. A harmonious relationship with one&rsquo;s environment is clearly not necessary to live in the city, but it may be integral to one&rsquo;s mental well-being. What the right approach for art is, I cannot say, but it is important that it maintain a foothold in the natural world even as the world grows increasingly artificial. Anything else risks losing the harmonies that only nature can produce, as we descend into a world of lines, boxes, and rectangles.\r\n <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cast of Characters:</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Alice</b>: Me, the narrator, an intern assigned to work in the kitchen of P.S. 98 in the Bronx assisting Helene, the Chef in Residence. Interested in the so-called \u201cschool food movement,\u201d I chose to do my culinary school internship with a program that works in public school kitchens to make the food healthier. As the least important person in the kitchen, it seems incongruous to put myself first; I am, however, moderately central to the story.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Maria</b>: The cook in charge of dinner, whose reputation is tarnished by the defective training she received under a former employee who was less than efficient. Also, by her habit of asking where things are before she looks through the refrigerator really thoroughly. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Helene</b>: The \u201cChef in Residence\u201d from my program, let\u2019s call it HealthFood, dedicated to improving health in New York City Public Schools, so, my boss. She lives in the suburbs with her husband, who is a contractor, and, to hear her tell it, an extremely handsome man, basically identical to both Samuel L. Jackson and Denzel Washington. Extremely concerned by Maria\u2019s habit of not searching the refrigerator well enough, and also quite proud of her own refrigerator searching skills.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Edith</b>: The head cook of the kitchen of P.S. 98, and a very sassy lady. Her management style consists of creative, humorous hyperbolic attacks on her employees and is startlingly effective\u2014she manages to be a good boss and close personal friends with all of her employees at the same time. Her husband died several years ago, and now she lives with a man who doesn\u2019t cook as well as her husband did, but is pretty nice.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Star</b>: Edith\u2019s main assistant, and her companion for frequent concerts, spa days, and nights at the club (they are both grandmothers, but still have it going on). She likes her men dark, but for some reason the ones she ends up with are always \u201chigh yeller.\u201d Her motto is that all kids like to feel special, so she goes out of her way to give them secret extra helpings, triple-decker PB and J\u2019s, and other treats. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Juanita</b>: The cook in charge of prekindergarten and breakfast, who also still has it going on, despite being of an age even more advanced than that of Edith and Star. This did not stop a young man dressed only in a Speedo and a cowboy hat from pursuing her down a Miami beach because \u201cMama looks good in her bathing suit.\u201d She talks about her cats, and their veterinary bills, and her daughter, a lot.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Ines</b>: The cook in charge of lunch, and the certified food handler. Cute as a button, she is always kind and always running into the cafeteria to force food on her young children and nephew, all of whom go to our school. When her picky daughter accepts anything anyone cooks, it is a cause of general celebration. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Adam</b>: In charge of supplies, receiving shipments, heavy lifting. Often discusses the disciplining of children with Star, as his son with his ex-wife has many behavioral problems which stem partly, he feels, from different levels of discipline in the two homes. He sometimes misses school to make sure the kid isn\u2019t playing video games while he\u2019s suspended.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Leroy</b>: Like Adam, at least as far as job description is concerned. He too, is married, and thinking of moving with his wife to the Bronx. Known for his (clever) habit of leaving at the end of his shift without saying goodbye, because if he came in to the kitchen to say goodbye someone would give him one last task, and there\u2019s definitely no overtime. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Janine</b>: The new girl. Tries to avoid serving (as in, serving the kids instead of prepping in the back) at all costs, and often worries about things like whether or not she has blood cancer; there is no evidence to suggest she does, she \u201cjust thinks about it sometimes.\u201d \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>The Diary</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Week One, in which I begin my job, sleepy and filled with foreboding, and am addressed as \u201cGladys,\u201d \u201cPat,\u201d \u201cCathy,\u201d and \u201cAlexis,\u201d among other things.</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Monday</b>: \u201cCilantro is good for you.\u201d Today I discovered that our job is only to improve the food given to one third of the school (because it\u2019s really two schools, and we only have a relationship with the junior high that rents space from the elementary school), and to leave the others to rot, and that the fresh vegetables brought to the school for our program are mostly herbs (a sprig of parsley on every plate is the new chicken in every pot, apparently) and mostly getting slimy. I made a cilantro pesto consisting of cilantro and Culinary Oil\u2122, and was asked if I \u201ccan follow a recipe.\u201d I said I could, though I had a bad feeling that I was not destined to have an opportunity to back up this assertion.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Tuesday</b>: \u201cPlease, one without the green stuff!\u201d Today was the day I found out that, if I arrive before Helene, Edith will give me a menial and trying job that has nothing to do with the healthy food program. Not coincidentally, today was also the day I spent five hours ladling canned peaches into small plastic cups, then putting lids on said cups. A child, presented with a turkey, cheese, lettuce and tomato sandwich, tearfully begged for one \u201cwithout the green stuff\u201d; one was proffered, but, seemingly too traumatized by his brush with verdure, he went away with no lunch. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Wednesday</b>: \u201cThey look like\u2026\u201d \u201cNo! Don\u2019t say it!\u201d \u201c\u2026worms!\u201d  Today I made a loaf of \u201cpeanut butter\u201d sandwiches, then had to re-do all of them, because apparently the jelly was implied. The denizens of the kitchen, usually unfazed by vacuum packed pre-dressed salads and the like (because they are more fazed by the idea of actually dealing with fresh vegetables?), take up arms against poisoning children with processed foods because of the apparently horrifying girth of the lo mein noodles that arrived in the shipment from HealthFood. The cole slaw that didn\u2019t have to be refrigerated was taken in stride. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Thursday</b>: \u201cThe bananas cannot be touching each other.\u201d Today all the ladies (except Helene, of course) congratulated me for \u201cinventing\u201d the method of ripening bananas by putting them in bags with other bananas that are already ripe, and thereby saving Adam\u2019s life (the unfortunate had accepted the shipment of 9 cases of green bananas, because, it later became clear, they are not allowed to reject shipments; this did not increase anyone\u2019s sympathy for Adam.) I then sorted the bananas into \u2018more green\u2019 and \u2018more yellow\u2019, rendering ten cases of the latter. I was told these, while comparatively yellow, were still too green, so I re-sorted, rendering four trays of the yellowest of the yellow. I was interrupted by an officious Department of Education dignitary who directed me to spread the bananas, not touching each other, on trays to ripen from the electric light. After he left, a peeved Edith directed me to return them to the bags to ripen according to our previous method. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Friday</b>: \u201cI felt it! I felt it!\u201d Today I (failed to) drastically improve the health of the school by putting a teaspoon of broccoli on each of two hundred pizza slices, then covering said broccoli with at least a tablespoon of extra cheese. Star grabbed her neck and ran back and forth through the kitchen, shouting \u201cI felt it, I felt it!\u201d\u2014a cockroach had fallen onto her neck from the ceiling. Juanita thought she had been visited by the Holy Spirit until she saw the roach in the sink. I made ten loaves of peanut butter (and jelly) sandwiches. \t\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Week 2, in which my relationship with Helene nosedives, but I am largely supported by the other ladies, despite the fact that no one knows my name yet. Gladys, Cathy, etc., are partially replaced by \u201cbabe,\u201d \u201cbaby,\u201d \u201cmama,\u201d and \u201cmamita,\u201d perhaps because everyone\u2019s failure to know my name has become embarrassing.</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Monday</b>: \u201cMy man, my lover, my roommate, my king.\u201d Today I learned about everyone\u2019s love life, including Star\u2019s relationship with the custodian (one way or imaginary affair? Unclear: he only giggled in response to references to him as \u201cMr. Star\u201d and \u201cStar\u2019s boo\u201d), and Edith\u2019s change of heart about her much maligned partner due to his having agreed to buy her a 37\u201d HD TV. Helene encouraged her to refer to him as her \u201cking\u201d and ditch all use of the word \u201cfriend\u201d; I found my relationship with Helene growing strained, perhaps as a result of this comment, and perhaps because of our later disagreement on whether eating fat causes once to become fat, or whether excess calories are to blame. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Tuesday</b>: \u201cIt\u2019s always something.\u201d Today Janine got very upset over the anniversary of her brother\u2019s death, and Helene told her to just get over it and move on. Meanwhile, I divided my time between horror at Helene\u2019s callousness, and confusion at who on earth Janine was, because I\u2019d never seen her before and no one seemed to be expecting her. I made peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and ham and cheese wraps, and Helene made a bunch of salad dressings. Maria did something smart (unspecified) and was congratulated by the ladies: \u201cMaria\u2019s back! Out from under Jawani (a former and apparently not stellar employee with whom Maria used to work the supper shift)!\u201d and \u201cWow Maria, she on today! Smart cookie for once!\u201d I jokingly reproached them, saying \u201cCome on! Maria has been smart before!\u201d; Helene turned to me with a look of incredulity to explain that \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand, Maria is not very smart, this is very unusual.\u201d Maria carried her tray out to begin third shift lunch service. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Wednesday</b>: Hooky! Ill-timed, as it happened\u2026 Maria was out with strep and Juanita was out with a cold, so apparently 1. A plague has struck the kitchen and 2. Everyone was really busy in our absence. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Thursday</b>: \u201cIt\u2019s a power thing.\u201d Today Helene had a one-way power struggle with Edith (despite being one way, it was a no-contest) using me as a proxy; how much garlic sauce to make for the garlic bread and how to cut and then prepare said bread were both topics peevishly discussed. I was filled with ill-suppressed irritation; I ate lunch with the ladies in the lunch room for the first time. The children were forced to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d in unison as a form of punishment, as well as a song called something like \u201cPut Your Head On\u201d? I couldn\u2019t understand either when the children sang it or when the ladies told me its title, which they somehow gleaned from the children\u2019s incomprehensible singing. Ines explained that she is able to shrug off Edith\u2019s frequent unfounded accusations of theft because her husband frequently levels similar accusations. Edith found her pen, apologized.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Friday</b>: \u201cYou could do more than you\u2019re doing.\u201d I roasted red peppers for Edith; Helene came in and suggested that I needn\u2019t bother, because \u201call children hate red peppers.\u201d Then she insisted that blanched spinach would be a kid-friendly pizza topping. I added vegetables to the pizzas while Helene, making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, individually critiqued each slice. My irritation was apparently obvious to the other ladies, who kept saying things like \u201cpoor Gladys,\u201d or squeezing my arm affectionately while struggling to remember my name. Star and I discussed people who have babies when they should just get dogs; I horrified everyone by revealing that I was in sixth grade when \u201cNo Scrubs\u201d came out. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/3/tom-alice.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Tom Tian</i></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Week 3, in which I stop dwelling on the fact that we do not actually improve the health quality of the food at the school and that no one in the school ever eats vegetables, and embrace the satisfying aspects of the work, like wrapping and stacking high fructose corn syrup-filled sandwiches really nicely.</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Monday</b>: \u201cPbbth.\u201d No one was in a good mood, probably because it was Monday, but many were sporting new \u2018dos (Star, Adam.) We ran out of jelly (!) so the PB&J kids were forced to eat cheese sandwiches or do without. Even Star\u2019s special kids, for whom she makes custom triple-decker peanut butters, had to eat pasta (we always serve mac \u2018n\u2019 cheese or lasagna on Mondays, because it\u2019s \u201cPlant Based Food Day\u201d according to the new schedule. We mostly celebrate that famous plant \u201ccheese.\u201d) I grated carrots, added them to salads, washed oranges, cut oranges, put oranges in bags, and put bags of oranges in coolers; I diced green peppers for the next day\u2019s potato salad, then, according to Helene\u2019s instructions, removed the eyes from ten pounds of baby red potatoes. The she said, what the heck, let\u2019s just peel them. So then I peeled twenty or thirty of them, before leaving work (half an hour late) and agreeing to peel the rest tomorrow. Edith stuck her tongue out at Helene behind Helene\u2019s back. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Tuesday</b>: \u201cI have to turn on the bathroom light.\u201d Today I made sandwiches, unsurprisingly on a sandwich day with two (2!) cooks out sick, and listened to Leroy and Helene discuss the importance of treating men like the head of the household. Star and Edith expressed skepticism that men are even generally qualified to act as such. I revisited my suspicion that Leroy has a mental deficiency of some kind: he can\u2019t seem to focus his eyes, or easily call to mind words like \u201cvegetable,\u201d or even \u201cpizza.\u201d However, he held his own in the argument with Helene, a fact which could swing the balance of evidence in either direction. On the one hand, his arguments were cogent, if somewhat chauvinist; on the other hand, he didn\u2019t seem to realize that she was agreeing with him. His first wife might be able to shed light on the matter, but apparently she\u2019s a psycho whose psycho-ness is rivaled only by that of the chick who punched Star\u2019s son on the street, and continued hitting him until attacked back by Star and her daughter, Emerald. This incident led Star to take Chris Brown\u2019s side. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEdith forgot her hairnet for hours and thus looked much sassier and more stylish than usual, though the health inspector might not have thought so. My wrap-making technique was universally applauded, and my attempts to reassure everyone about the cobra that recently escaped from the Bronx Zoo (weather too cold for reptiles) were only partially successful\u2014it is very warm, one is reminded, in warm water pipes, and in sewers. The ladies did not feel as comfortable going to the bathroom in the dark as they once did. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Wednesday</b>: \u201cThey robbed the babies.\u201d Today I discovered Juanita\u2019s unpopularity with the children and its cause, namely that she refuses to give anyone extra ever. I sliced tomatoes and cucumbers for the salad bar, and prepared a spinach salad (universally considered disgusting), also for the salad bar. Adam\u2019s son was still sick, so he was replaced in the office by Tyree, who was, predictably enough, teased by Edith, comforted by Star, ogled by Juanita (reference should be made to her cowboy-in-a-Speedo story), and actually (inappropriately) pursued by Janine, who, when not preoccupied by death or hypochondria, is chasing tail. Junior high students stole all of the pre-kindergarteners\u2019 snack time strawberries, an event unsurprising to anyone who has ever had to walk through the school carrying visible strawberries.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Thursday</b>: \u201cThey loved the red peppers.\u201d Today Helene, irrespective of her former extreme resistance to roasted red peppers, took credit for the enthusiasm the students actually turned out to feel for the red peppers, and Edith and I generally shared glances about the all-around excessive devotion to making things from scratch exhibited by Helene\u2019s biweekly hour-long French dressing-making extravaganza; seriously, we have cans of that in the back.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Friday</b>: \u201cWe don\u2019t get paid to think.\u201d Today I made pizza toppings, and it became clear that Helene will contradict everything I say, even when it is clearly a joke, and no matter if she agrees with it or not. The ladies called me into the back on a pretext to commiserate on the subject of Helene treating everyone like a complete idiot, commenting that \u201cwe don\u2019t get paid to think,\u201d a fact which explains the fact that she thinks she knows how to do everything better than we do. I remarked that \u201cI don\u2019t get paid at all,\u201d which perhaps explains why I am so unwise as to express the results of my cogitations to Helene. Star tried out my peanut butter and jelly making method, and said it helps her keep focus when sleepy. We discussed Lorena Bobbit, briefly, but came to no conclusions. \r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Week 4, in which I earn my place and am given my badge of membership.</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Monday</b>: \u201cI\u2019m going to have to cut Alice.\u201d Today the custodian (to whom Star is jokingly romantically linked, and possibly actually romantically linked, but I don\u2019t think so) told Star that he liked my shoes. Although he \u201ctried to save it\u201d by saying that they matched her shirt, she still threatened to cut me, a threat she repeated several times, all the while mysteriously remembering my name. She relented later, announcing, \u201cI\u2019m not going to cut you, \u2018cause I love you, but I\u2019m going to slice you, \u2018cause he likes you!\u201d Edith also flew into a joking rage when I wouldn\u2019t translate the head count of how many kids ate (it\u2019s always delivered in Spanish, which she does not speak), so, all in all, today everyone got mad at me except Helene! Definitely a first.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Tuesday</b>: \u201cShe\u2019s a Bronx girl now.\u201d Sandwich day, hectic as always, especially as Maria was out with pneumonia and strep throat (Helene missed this bulletin and continued to make Maria-is-a-slacker jokes, apparently without noticing that the atmosphere was less receptive than usual) and Janine was out, legitimately just being a slacker. Helene\u2019s hostility toward me was more naked than usual (it\u2019s usually completely clothed), to the extent that Star, out of pity, decided she was not going to cut OR slice me. Edith, trying to claim the leftover hummus as hers and hers alone, licked a finger meaningfully and stuck it in, saying, \u201cYou see that? Now don\u2019t eat any of this!\u201d When I replied that her exhibition only made me want to eat it more, everyone hooted with laughter and shouted out \u201cShe been in the Bronx too long! She\u2019s a Bronx girl now.\u201d There was a pause, then Helene added in a flat, factual tone, \u201cAlice is nasty.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Wednesday</b>: \u201cI love you.\u201d Today I served for the first time! Still short of staff, after spending most of the day preparing salad greens (19 bags of pre-chopped romaine that expire tomorrow), other salad bar items, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (the bread of which, unfortunately, did not have time to fully thaw before service), and cheese sandwiches, I went out and served with Juanita, the iron fist. Child after child begged piteously for more food (the serving sizes were little over a tablespoon or two, it seemed) only to be rejected without a second thought by Juanita; they would then beseech me in whispers, which, as I was standing a mere six inches from Juanita, availed them less than it might\u2019ve if I\u2019d been left to my own devices. When I went into the back room at the end of the day to get the locker room keys, Star stopped me to give me a hug and tell me that she loved me. Tapping on our shoulders saying \u201cI\u2019m jealous!\u201d Edith then gave me a big hug and said she loved me. And that she could do without Helene. Then I went home. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Thursday</b>: \u201cHere\u2019s your own thermometer.\u201d On this chicken day, I was put in charge of putting together the salad bar, marinating, cooking, and panning up all the chicken, as well as making tomorrow\u2019s pizza toppings and a tomato sauce for next week\u2019s chicken. This was notable only because Helene mostly helped with dishes and cleaned out the fridge. Nothing appeared wrong with this arrangement until I was staggering around under multiple, heavy pans of chicken, with nary a door or stove opening hand. However, everyone commended the way I cooked the chicken (not the feat it might be, considering the chicken is pre-cooked and one need only thaw/warm it) and Ines gave me my own thermometer straight from the package! She got it from the back room, and handed it to Helene to hand off to me; I thought I detected a hint of jealously in Helene\u2019s mien when she passed it off to me. I pinned it proudly to my apron, and stabbed it with an ever more diluted sense of pride into many successive pieces of chicken. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Friday</b>: \u201cWe\u2019ll scare her away.\u201d Janine came back today, after quite a bit of time out sick, and complained constantly about how antibiotics make her sleepy, an observation of questionable relevance when paired with her other theme of the day, namely, that she had not taken any antibiotics despite how sick she is. Ines, usually such a gentle and kind soul, didn\u2019t cut her a break all day, and was backed up by Edith. She later revealed to me that this is a plan, and not the first operation of its kind, to pester inefficient and whiny workers into applying to transfer schools; she\u2019s unable to do this to Helene, as she\u2019s not a HealthFood employee, so we have to just wait her out. With Janine, on the other hand, they are taking a more active approach, and (we?) plan to have her gone by summer break. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Week 5, in which everyone gets a little personal.</h3>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Monday</b>: \u201cI had to wake up and watch Joel Osteen.\u201d Today, Star confessed to having lewd dreams which she could not control, and thus, to having gotten very little sleep this weekend, instead watching televangelists late into the night to try to get a handle on the situation. As she said, \u201cSister Meow\u201d wants what she wants, but you have to control her with your mind and not let her do all the thinking! All the ladies offered mostly unprintable advice, except Helene, who just kept saying \u201cOh Lord\u201d and Juanita, who just kept saying \u201cYeah but it\u2019s better than being married! I didn\u2019t like that at all,\u201d while gravely shaking her head.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Tuesday</b>: \u201cAdam is a giant baby.\u201d Yesterday Adam came in with a huge bandage encompassing, to hear Star tell it, practically his entire arm. When questioned, he said he had cut himself at work, so Edith told the supervisor, who told him to come in to the Field Office to report his injury, so today he didn\u2019t arrive until noon or so. He came without even a Band Aid, and when asked about his cut pointed to a barely pink scratch on part of his thumb. He apparently had not been told why he was going in to the office, and was mortified when they asked him to fill out five papers about his injury\u2014he said he bandaged it the way he did because he was out of Band Aids. Everyone else agreed that he\u2019d probably cut himself out of sadness when Maria was out sick, and finally he wore down and said he\u2019d been trying to carve an \u201cM\u201d into his hand and messed up. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Wednesday</b>: \u201cI want some sexy meat.\u201d We began lunch service at 10 (if you can call it lunch at that hour) with some trepidation, as we were feeding the kids black beans instead of kidney beans today and replacing the white rice with brown, substitutions that would affect mostly the visual, it is true, but might well have caused a riot. Things went smoothly, however, with even Ines\u2019 picky daughter eating some rice, and, though I spent most of the day making peanut butters for those children that rejected the beans, there were fewer than usual. Maria\u2019s request for some \u201csexy meat,\u201d which she repeated again and again after each hysterical response (Edith, striking a pose: \u201cIt\u2019s all sexy, how much you want?\u201d Juanita: \u201cAdam can you get you some if you don\u2019t got it!\u201d Star: \u201cThat\u2019s what I been dreaming of!\u201d). Finally I asked her what kind of meat? And she said, \u201cIt says sexy on the package! Z-E-S-T-Y.\u201d Then everyone made fun of her for being an immigrant, and I wondered what on earth \u201czesty meat\u201d was. It turns out to be red shredded stuff that comes in a bag, and not from any animal in particular. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Thursday</b>: \u201cThees ees feenger.\u201d Today, during a dispute about whether a salt container is called a box or a bottle (I would go with carton, but I kept my mouth shut), Edith played the race card and announced to Ines in an accent straight out of West Side Story, \u201cIn Amereeka thees ees bottle, thees ees box. In Puerto Rico, everytheeng bottle, but in Amereeka thees ees box.\u201d Ines, after first telling me to avert my gaze, responded, \u201cIn Amereeka, thees ees feenger,\u201d and flicked Edith off. Everyone laughed, Ines saying, \u201cWe been working together a long time!\u201d The plan to scare Janine away hit a major roadblock today, as she spent most of the day on the phone reporting unfriendly and unfair workplace treatment she had received at the hands of Ines and Juanita. The supervisor seemed understandably incredulous (but not correctly, as it happened). Everyone was pretty annoyed that she was on the phone instead of working, but, somewhat surprisingly, her actions were seen as fair play and she was treated totally normally on her emergence from the office. It seems that, in complaining, she has shown the necessary spunk to be accepted.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Friday</b>: \u201cWe family, in this kitchen.\u201d Everyone was in a great mood today because we have next week off! Also, we did so much extra work yesterday there was hardly anything to do today except stand around drinking tea with condensed milk, and cook off fifty-odd trays of pizza. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nToward the end of the day, as we were getting ready to clean up and head home, Janine brought out an ice cream cake that she had brought in with her. Maria cut pieces for everyone and Star called everyone in to the kitchen. Everyone was thanking Janine and eating her cake\u2014she said she\u2019d brought it in \u201cbecause at first I was like, \u2018Oh my God these people,\u2019 but now I think I understand you and you understand me, so let\u2019s have some cake!\u201d Everyone laughed and agreed. Then Star pulled Helene in to complete the circle (she had opted out of the ice cream cake\u2014health, you know) and said she had a speech to give, hopefully without crying.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cWe family, in this kitchen. I want to thank you, Janine, for this cake, and I want to thank of all of you, because we all look out for each other in here. But we also have to look out for each other out there\u2014you\u2019ll all be in my prayers, but stay careful this break! I want to see everyone come back here safe after Easter.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cAlso, lets pray\u2014\u201d (Maria threw in an \u201cAmen, Lord!\u201d here) \u201c\u2014for all of us, for our families, and for Janine, that the things she\u2019s facing in her life get easier\u2014help her carry her burdens, Lord!\u201d There were murmurs of assent from the gathering\u2014Janine started to cry quietly and slipped away to the back room, saying, \u201cSorry!\u201d Edith said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry babe, I go back there when I need to scream, everyone knows that!\u201d Then everyone else went around the circle hugging each other and wishing each other a happy Easter. Star told me to stay away from her boo (he had come in to the kitchen too) and got out a knife to drive her point home. Janine came out, wiping her eyes, and had some more cake, and we all speculated a little about this and that, like whether the custodian had a foot fetish, then packed up and went home.  <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>Karaite Judaism, by rejecting the Rabbinite oral law, seems to commit a heresy against the interpretive techniques that define what most people, Jew and goy alike, imagine to be Jewish thought. For partisans of the Rabbinic movement, then, the temptation arises to delegitimize Karaism on its own terms, to prove that it is somehow not authentically Jewish. This was my first reaction to Karaism. Unfortunately, such a stance leads nowhere, at least nowhere that I wanted to go. Mr. Garelick\u2019s project on Karaism throttles that temptation, and instead explains how the Karaite provocation can clarify the Rabbinite stance. I would like to extend that aim by proposing an analogy between these two Jewish hermeneutical systems and two similarly competing strains of American jurisprudence.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>In deciding a law\u2019s validity, the dominant ideology of constitutionalism draws not only on the text of the Constitution itself but on the written opinions of past jurists who have decided similar questions. These opinions are validated, in turn, not by the clarity with which they hew to the text, but by the usefulness of the tools that they produce. One category of juridical tool is what is known as a \u201ctest,\u201d which is supposed to clarify the (at times intentionally) vague language of the legal authority being interpreted.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Judges have devised a set of tests to determine, for example, whether a law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. Does any law that distinguishes between people violate equal protection? Not according to widely accepted tests. If a law singles out an \u201cordinary class\u201d of people\u2014residents of urban areas, say\u2014it faces what\u2019s called an \u201ceasy test,\u201d and is presumed to be valid unless counsel can show that it advances no conceivable rational state interest. If a law targets a \u201csuspect class\u201d\u2014a group that has historically faced unfair discrimination, such as a racial group\u2014it faces a \u201chard test\u201d (also called \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d), and is presumed to be invalid unless counsel can show that it advances a compelling interest. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>Of course, the fact that we have such tests does not mean that ruling on equal protection cases is made trivial. Conservatives argue that homosexuals are not a suspect class, and that laws forbidding gay marriage should therefore face an easy test. When the Supreme Court inevitably hears a challenge to the Defense of Marriage Act, the question of which test to use will surely be a major consideration. And while laws targeting a racial group have generally faced an unambiguous hard test, laws targeting women have sometimes faced \u201cintermediate scrutiny,\u201d as opposed to the \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d of a hard test or \u201crational basis review\u201d of an easy test. In order to pass \u201cintermediate scrutiny,\u201d it must be shown that the law under consideration advances an important state interest in a way that is substantially related to that interest.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The Rabbinite obligation to the weedlike mess of interpretive tradition is apparent in this modern approach to jurisprudence. Though its appearance is not nearly so exotic, I contend that the scheme of constitutional scrutiny evokes the same \u201cbewildering litany of strangenesses\u201d that a Rabbinic interpreter faces. If this test is supposed to clarify the equal protection clause, why does it point us to an even wider range of questions? Within what parameters do we determine historically unfair discrimination? Where should intermediate scrutiny be applied, other than in cases of gender distinction? What is a rational interest? What is a compelling interest? What is an important state interest?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Although a judge is charged with interpreting the law, no one would dream of deciding an equal protection case without a discussion of scrutiny. Tools such as this one emerge historically in our jurisprudence and are honed and refined by successive generations. Yet jurists are bound by the principle of <i>stare decisis</i> not to disturb settled, precedented legal matters. Despite the refrain of conservative constitutionalists that the Constitution does not specify a right to an abortion, <i>Roe v. Wade</i> will not be overturned unless the Court can devise a new legal standard of review, not necessarily one that reflects a plain reading of the Constitution, but one that accounts decisively for the arguments made in <i>Roe</i>.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, this juridical ideology allows for the same kind of freedom and mobility that the Rabbinic tradition affords. For example, federal courts have never found members of an income group to be a suspect class. However, a California court did almost that in the 1980s when it found that a landlord discriminated against poor renters by charging 3 months\u2019 rent as security deposit (of course, the responsible judge, a personal hero of mine, was thrown out by voters in a vile smear campaign a few years later). Who\u2019s to say that a federal judge won\u2019t some day resurrect Justice Rose Bird\u2019s opinion and strike down a law that fails strict scrutiny on the basis of income discrimination?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, some jurists, especially conservatives such as Robert Bork, Clarence Thomas, and Antonin Scalia, adhere to the doctrines of originalism, which prioritizes the original intended meaning of the text, and textualism, which prioritizes the plain meaning of the text. Both of these doctrines are incidental to mainstream jurisprudence. Karaitic interpretation, similarly, understands the words of the Torah in terms of what they would mean to the Israelites who received them. This is not quite the same as Justice Antonin Scalia's brand of <i>authorial</i> originalism, which looks to the <i>intent of the framers</i> to direct his review, but close kin. Of course, no modern jurist fully rejects the obligations to case law and <i>stare decisis</i> the way Karaism rejects the oral law. So Scalia is a bit like a Jew born into a Rabbinic community, and thus bound by its procedures while harboring his own Karaitic tendencies. Strangely, the flexibility of our jurisprudence actually allows Scalia to pursue those tendencies without repudiating the whole system.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Karaites claim that the only authority is scripture itself, and reject oral law because it relies on the authority of the Rabbis. Conservative constitutionalists (motivated, perhaps, by a certain Protestant insistence upon the <i>a priori</i> legitimacy of a layman\u2019s reading of the Bible?) claim that the only judge of constitutionality is adherence to the literal text of the document. In other words, these ideologies reject human authority in favor of the natural authority of reason itself. I would argue that this rational access to scripture/text cannot, on its own, produce an authoritatively valid legal code. In theory, if not in practice, a Karaite Jew could reject his community\u2019s interpretation of scripture, and devise his own ritual program based on his own interpretation, just as the Protestants did in Europe. I concede, of course, that Karaism nonetheless maintains a coherent tradition, but its effect as law is not connected to Karaitic hermeneutics. Karaism does rely on human authority to thwart errancy and thereby sustain tradition, as do all legal systems. In fact, according to Mr. Garelick, \u201cin many of its iterations, Karaite tradition is filled out by borrowing from Rabbinic tradition.\u201d The great advantage of the oral law is that the social relationship that authorizes the legal code\u2014the march of generations, handing down the oral Torah from one to the next\u2014is built into Rabbinic scriptural ideology.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>But this is not meant to be an exercise in validation, or any other claim to truth or authenticity. During the period of the Second Temple, the Sadducees were a Jewish sect distinguished by their rivalry with the Pharisees, a Rabbinic sect, and associated (though not coterminous) with the \u201cTemple aristocracy.\u201d The Sadducees never existed outside Israel, since their religious roles were heavily bound to Temple service. Although the Karaite sect only emerged centuries later, they consider themselves to be heirs to the Sadducee tradition, which, like Karaism, held oral law to be an unwarranted addition to written scripture. Rabbinical Judaism, on the other hand, was the product of more than a millennium of ritual innovations related to the exile of the Jewish people, which began about 600 BCE with the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem and the destruction of the First Temple. Since the Torah\u2019s religious system depended, for its literal fulfillment, on the existence of the Temple and the availability of holy things, Jews in exile were forced to improvise, to escape literalism. After the Second Temple was destroyed in 70 CE, the Sadducees ceased to exist as a religious phenomenon. Rabbinism became, and has remained, the dominant Jewish hermeneutic.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Karaites do, of course, submit to the need for improvisation and innovation. The capacity to improvise is perhaps necessary for the survival of any cultural system. We could restate the difference between the two sects, then, by saying that Rabbinic invention is authorized by scripture (the Rabbinic interpretation of scripture) while the authority of Karaite innovations must itself be invented. In the same way, conservative constitutionalism is forced to start from scratch when a new question arises, whereas a legally trained jurist inherits an arsenal of improvisatory techniques from past scholars. It is not only the freedom to invent, but the positive injunction to validate such inventions, that ensures the continued utility of the Rabbinic and modern legal systems. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nIn the last issue, Marcel Knudsen traced the development of a certain attitude toward natural beauty as exemplified by the abstract artist Piet Mondrian.  The view, roughly, is that \u201cnatural beauty\u201d is an oxymoron, and that artists are fortunate to be free of merely representing natural objects, free to work in the pure medium of color and geometric form. Knudsen pointed out rightly that Mondrian, as much as the supposedly naturalistic artists he criticized, was painting what he saw around him; only what he saw were the sharp lines and right angles of skyscrapers and traffic grids rather than the flowing curves and chaotic mottles of rocks and trees and water.  We were warned that such an attitude could be constricting, resulting in a stifling cycle of seeing only boxes and creating only boxes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn this Afterthought I wish to bring another view to bear on the question of how a city can be beautiful.  This view was expressed by another urban artist, the poet and essayist Charles Baudelaire, in the mid-19th century.</p>\r\n<p>Theologically, the view goes thus: ever since the Fall of Man, the natural world, including the more natural aspects of humanity, is thoroughly corrupt. By nature humans are purely self-interested, evil, and barbaric. All moral goodness comes from reason and calculation, which has given rise to religions and moral systems commanding and inspiring people to look out for their neighbors.  This is possible because each human has a soul, the seat of the rational and creative intellect.  Likewise, beauty exists because humans have a supernatural ideal of beauty and the imagination to embellish themselves and the world around them.  Baudelaire says that all fashion, of any period, is charming, because it represents one step further toward the ideal of beauty.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nBaudelaire qualifies his declaration that all fashion is charming, in readiness against the objection that fashion is extremely relative, temporally. Seemingly essential to the notion of fashion is that it is considered beautiful or attractive <i>now</i>, and just a few years or weeks ago or hence, it did not or will not have its appeal, being quaint or confusing or ugly or boring rather than attractive. So he asks us to accept, at least, that any fashion was once justifiably charming, compared to what had come before.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut Baudelaire himself does embrace the stronger claim, does himself embrace the fashion of any given age, if it is viewed in the right light. The right light, we learn in \u201cThe Painter of Modern Life,\u201d is that of historical particularity itself. Baudelaire explains here that any work of art has a double composition. The first component is whatever the work possesses of ideal, eternal beauty. The second is whatever reveals its historical particularity\u2014the manners, fashions, tastes, moralities of the period in which it was created, which inevitably suffuse it. This second element is not something added on to\u2014perhaps obscuring\u2014the first, an unavoidable result of human artists (in the manner of some apologies for apparent barbarisms celebrated in religious texts: the text was divinely inspired and contains divine truth, but the human hands it passed through were bound to introduce some impurities). Rather, Baudelaire\u2019s idea is much more Kantian.  Being humans and persons of a particular age and manner, we always understand a work through its historical particularity or fashion.  Fashion is what makes the eternal component at all digestible or palatable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat use is all this? It may help us if we find ourselves trapped in a depressing dichotomy. On the one hand, the view that all beauty is found in the natural world, which makes cities seem like bleak, spiritually suffocating places, with only the consolation of city parks which can feel more like zoos for trees than anything else. On the other hand there is the view that art can only reach its heights by rejecting the imitation of nature: the downsides (and perhaps incoherence) of which Knudsen pointed out. Baudelaire, I think, offers a subtler and aesthetically profitable way of seeing the city. When we look at the Manhattan skyline or walk through industrial Gowanus, we are seeing layer upon layer of human creations, products of different historical points, individual aspirations, aesthetic tastes, moral pressures, fashions. It is through this lens of human richness that I suggest we view the city around us. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>It is difficult to say exactly where the so-called \"lemon break\" originated. It was passed down to us by an old friend, or rather an acquaintance, whose name we have long since forgotten. Even then it was something of a mystery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The origin of the name is likewise unknown, but whoever introduced the terminology did so aptly. It is a break in many senses\u2014a break from work, a break in reality, a braking of motion, a breaking of light through a window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult to explain the ritual to someone who has not experienced it directly. However, carrying it out requires little time or preparation, so there is no real obstacle for anyone who seeks firsthand knowledge of the phenomenon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typical break proceeds as follows. First a lemon<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup> must be procured. Once at hand it is cut in half and each half squeezed into a glass of water. The ritual involves two people; there is one glass for each.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lemon having been squeezed, the participants retire to a sunny room and seat themselves comfortably. Each person will seek out the place in the room that best suits their mood or inclinations, and will typically remain there for the duration of the break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is essential that the break be carried out at an appropriate time of day. Three or four in the afternoon is usually best. However, the deciding factor is the quality of the light entering the room, and this will vary depending not only on the weather but also the season and latitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once seated, the participants sip their lemon water and disengage themselves. They may do this by fixing their gaze on a shadow as it moves across the wall, or a cloud in the sky, or even the lemon particles floating in their glass. It is best to focus on an object that is slowly or imperceptibly changing, and allow oneself to be drawn into its motion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is hard to describe exactly what happens during the next hour or so, and we can only speak for ourselves on this matter. The objects in the room appear to take on a certain softness, and blur into one another. One becomes aware of even slight changes in the atmosphere, for example a darkening of the room as a cloud passes by, or leaves fluttering in the breeze. One becomes absorbed in these changes and loses oneself in them. The presence of another being is crucial at this stage, for a sort of reassurance or grounding as one passes through layers of ecstatic unification with one's surroundings. There is typically no conversation during the break, as this would be extremely difficult, but there is a sort of mutual understanding and accepting of the circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a sense, little outside of the ordinary occurs during a break. It is more like an accumulation and perfection of the mundane, an amplification of the usual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many have speculated about a physiological mechanism that regulates one's mental state during a break. It seems unlikely to be a purely chemical effect, for the simple reason that eating a lemon typically has little effect on one's consciousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the lemon does seem to be an essential part of the process, since omitting it quite lessens the intensity of the experience. This has prompted some to reject comparisons with other reflective activities such as meditation or deep breathing, which do not typically have such a physical/chemical component.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others have speculated that there is a divine or heavenly cause. Perhaps the lemon water acts as a spiritual cleansing agent, clearing a channel for communication with a deity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the wisest have concluded that we will never know exactly what happens during a break. They say: those who do not wish to go blind do not stare at the sun. Our role is to take part, and never to know. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\"><p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nSome have claimed to succeed with other citrus fruits, but for us the effect seems to be far more pronounced with a lemon. On the other hand, the experience of breaking does seem to vary dramatically from person to person, place to place, and time to time, so such reports are not entirely surprising.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Or should it simply watch bricks stack themselves upward into a shape that no one expected not to surprise?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question, what sort of novel is like life?, becomes the question, what is it like, \u201clife\u201d? What is life?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where is life?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When is life?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Something is sought, in any case; something is to be hunted down. \u201cLife,\u201d Virginia Woolf calls it in her essay, \u201cModern Fiction\u201d; and that\u2019s no more vague a word than \u201creality,\u201d she adds. And whatever we want to call it, we can at least be sure that \u201cthe form of fiction most in vogue more often misses than secures the thing we seek.\u201d And this in spite of the novelist providing \u201ccomedy, tragedy, love interest, and an air of probability embalming the whole so impeccable that if all his figures were to come to life they would find themselves dressed down to the last button of their coats in the fashion of the hour.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That kind of writing, \u201cmaterialist\u201d fiction as she calls it, is one of the realisms that Mrs. Dalloway opposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"a\"></a><a href=\"#a\" onMouseOver=\"toggleDiv('div1',1)\" onMouseOut=\"toggleDiv('div1',0)\">In <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, speech predominates.</a> <a href=\"#a\" onMouseOver=\"toggleDiv('div2',1)\" onMouseOut=\"toggleDiv('div2',0)\">Causes are brought into utterance by their effects.</a> <a href=\"#a\" onMouseOver=\"toggleDiv('div3',1)\" onMouseOut=\"toggleDiv('div3',0)\">Impressions transform the impressed, and belong to no one absolutely.</a> <a href=\"#a\" onMouseOver=\"toggleDiv('div4',1)\" onMouseOut=\"toggleDiv('div4',0)\">The strength of an impression carries the narrative forward</a>\u2014or rather, <a href=\"#a\" onMouseOver=\"toggleDiv('div5',1)\" onMouseOut=\"toggleDiv('div5',0)\">backward; there is an identity between the eternal and the past</a><a href=\"#a\" onMouseOver=\"toggleDiv('div6',1)\" onMouseOut=\"toggleDiv('div6',0)\">\u2014until interruptions send us speeding elsewhere.</a></p>\r\n<hr class=\"longhr\">\r\n<div id=\"div1\" style=\"visibility: hidden;\">\u201cMrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself.\u201d</div>\r\n<div id=\"div2\"  style=\"visibility: hidden;\">\u201cFor Lucy had her work cut out for her.

What a plunge!\u201d</div>\r\n<div id=\"div5\"  style=\"visibility: hidden;\">\u201cFor so it had always seemed her, when, with a little squeak of the hinges, which she could hear now, she had burst open the French windows and plunged at Bourton into the open air. How fresh, how calm, stiller than this of course, the air was in the early morning; like the flap of a wave; the kiss of a wave; chill and sharp and yet (for a girl of eighteen as she then was) solemn, feeling as she did, standing there at the open window, that something awful was about to happen; looking at the flowers, at the trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks rising, falling; standing and looking until\u201d</div>\r\n<div id=\"div6\"  style=\"visibility: hidden;\">\u201cuntil Peter Walsh said, \u2018Musing among the vegetables\u2019--was that it?--\u2019I prefer men to cauliflowers\u2019--was that it?\u201d</div>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"longhr\">\r\n\r\n<p>On the whole the effect is very different from that of \u201cmaterialist\u201d writing. The author says (again in \u201cModern Fiction\u201d):</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Examine for a moment an ordinary mind on an ordinary day. The mind receives a myriad impressions\u2014trivial, fantastic, evanescent, or engraved with the sharpness of steel. From all sides they come, an incessant shower of innumerable atoms; and as they fall, as they shape themselves into the life of Monday or Tuesday, the accent falls differently from of old; the moment of importance came not here but there; so that, if a writer were a free man and not a slave, if he could write what he chose, not what he must, if he could base his work upon his own feeling and not upon convention, there would be no plot, no comedy, no tragedy, no love interest or catastrophe in the accepted style, and perhaps not a single button sewn on as the Bond Street tailors would have it.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> shapes itself into a Wednesday. No omniscient narrator announces the time or place, or presents the events from a bird\u2019s eye view. If the narrator is a bird, it is a low-flying bird, swooping about, again and again needing to change direction, having no peripheral vision to rely upon. So we learn along the way that it\u2019s Wednesday, June, London, and not because it\u2019s in the rulebook that such information must eventually be conveyed, but because these things, along the way, make a real difference to Clarissa Dalloway, to what she has to say. Her morning walk is a pronouncement of her love of life and of London and of all London\u2019s parts; of \u201cgalloping ponies,\u201d of \u201ccricket bats,\u201d of \u201cabsurdly woolly dogs,\u201d of \u201cshopkeepers fidgeting in their windows\u201d; and she, too, is a part of it all, \u201cand she, too, was going that very night to kindle and illuminate; to give her party.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can feel the life in Woolf's approach\u2014it seems familiar and exciting all at once. A great deal separates it from the materialists, but to isolate one essential thing, each bit of text comes with a motivation: the narrator in flying low flies close to characters\u2019 actual voices. All parts of the narration seem to matter to a living creature. Even if it is unclear whether a particular character thinks the thought on the page, each thought implies some breathing, pulsating being, however ephemeral, for whom that thought does actually matter. A narrator that tries to efface itself in order to have an \u201cobjective\u201d grasp of reality risks focusing on things that can\u2019t possibly be meaningful to anyone, coat buttons for instance, if only in order to demonstrate its own non-being. Woolf\u2019s narrator instead makes its presence, or presences, felt, as various beings who are currently in the process of living. And these various beings\u2019 impressions shape themselves into things\u2014things that grab someone by the shoulders, things that settle all around someone, things that weigh upon someone; perhaps the very things we've been hunting for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We cross the day toward the party, but not methodically; the moments are not lined up on the examiner\u2019s table and turned over, one by one. Everything happens so breathlessly that we don\u2019t have time not to prioritize. We shoot off in only fruitful directions, to the past, to imaginary places; we seek out not what is small but what pulls. And it turns out that there is a great deal that pulls; we end up with a novel that contains not only the realities of a day, but of an entire lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> contains a struggle with a second, very different kind of realism. It is not a novelist\u2019s realism but a person\u2019s; Clarissa\u2019s old friend\u2019s, Peter Walsh\u2019s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flighty narrator visits Peter\u2019s memories at length.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Then Clarissa, still with an air of being offended with them all, got up, made some excuse, and went off, alone. As she opened the door, in came that great shaggy dog which ran after sheep. She flung herself upon him, went into raptures. It was as if she said to Peter\u2014it was all aimed at him, he knew\u2014\"I know you thought me absurd about that woman just now; but see how extraordinarily sympathetic I am; see how I love my Rob!\u201d</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>They had always this queer power of communicating without words. She knew directly he criticized her. Then she would do something quite obvious to defend herself, like this fuss with the dog\u2014but it never took him in, he always saw through Clarissa.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter always sees through things generally, but especially women, and especially Clarissa. Even the smallest insincerity doesn't escape him. \u201c\u2019Here is my Elizabeth!\u2019\u2014that annoyed him. Why not \u2018Here\u2019s Elizabeth\u2019 simply?\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The worst is when she makes polite introductions; he hates the charismatic distance she keeps from him, hates that she addresses him in a way that doesn\u2019t acknowledge their shared history. It frustrates him to no end to know her so terribly well but be barred nonetheless from the most intimate access to her. \u201cShe had always, even as a girl, a sort of timidity, which in middle age becomes conventionality,\u201d he thinks. These ushers of superficiality\u2014timidity, conventionality\u2014block all means of entry. She refuses to present her unguarded self to the world and thus forbids the world to grab hold of it. Even her dear Peter is doomed to know but only barely to touch. She is cold, he thinks; she is rigid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where the materialists may need every button on a man\u2019s coat to believe in his participation in reality, Peter needs something different from Clarissa. By refusing to engage the world (as he sees it), not only does she appear in an unreal (superficial, fake) form, but she bars the real from affecting her in turn. She avoids encountering things; she doesn\u2019t let reality show up in her life.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Here she is mending her dress; mending her dress as usual, he thought; here she\u2019s been sitting all the time I\u2019ve been in India; mending her dress; playing about; going to parties; running to the House and back and all that, he thought, growing more and more irritated, more and more agitated, for there\u2019s nothing in the world so bad for some women as marriage, he thought; and politics; and having a Conservative husband, like the admirable Richard.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>A lifeless life\u2014a life which escapes life not insofar as it is implausible but insofar as it shuts itself away so that nothing can touch it; this is Peter\u2019s accusation. Nothing happens in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, an obtuse critic might say; nothing happens in Mrs. Dalloway\u2019s life, says her own most vicious critic. Nothing happens because she avoids life (him). She has clothed herself in clouds and sparkles; she has chosen a husband who won\u2019t find his way into her head; she has lived superficially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We might well agree that marrying Richard instead of Peter avoids life. If <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> has a plot, it\u2019s Peter who drives it\u2014his entrance, their meeting, their reuniting after years apart, marks a scene of real suspense. And it is the only scene in which the narrator jumps rapidly back and forth between two characters\u2019 minds, using their shared thoughts as a hinge. Even the most traditional critic could not possibly deny that something \u201chappens\u201d here, in their extraordinary effect upon each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is at least one other moment where Clarissa and someone else have an unspoken understanding. It is when she runs into Hugh Whitbread, another friend, famously superficial:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Evelyn was a good deal out of sorts, said Hugh, intimating by a kind of pout [...] that his wife had some internal ailment, nothing serious, which, as an old friend, Clarissa Dalloway would quite understand without requiring him to specify. Ah yes, she did of course; what a nuisance; and felt very sisterly and oddly conscious at the same time of her hat.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>But the unspoken understandings of the superficial are nothing like the understandings between real friends, in which no distance is granted; once something is understood, it is shared property and it must be confessed. \u201cMrs. Dalloway will see me,\u201d Peter announces when he first arrives at her house; \u201cOh yes, she will see me,\u201d\u2014perfectly entitled, he makes his announcement and runs up the stairs; and of course he is right; she will see him. Whatever is given once, henceforth is demanded. That is the way of true friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cTell me the truth,\u201d Peter demanded, in the distant past, on the day she refused to marry him. \u201cTell me the truth,\u201d he repeated again and again, and thus drove her away. Years later, she still believes that \u201cin marriage a little licence, a little independence there must be between people living together day in day out in the same house; which Richard gave her and she him. [...] But with Peter everything had to be shared; everything gone into.\u201d (Those two men come up in quite telling contrast with respect to Hugh Whitbread: \u201cRichard was nearly driven mad by him, and as for Peter Walsh, he had never to this day forgiven her for liking him.\u201d)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But why should Clarissa decline to \u201cgo into\u201d things, if not as a retreat? Cast in the light of Peter\u2019s agitation, her morning walk and insistence that she loves life begin to seem as thin and false as her antics with the dog. She stands accused before the reader and before herself as well; she feels Peter's old criticisms even when she hasn't seen him for years. \u201cHow he scolded her!\u201d she remembers. \u201cHow they argued! She would marry a Prime Minister and stand at the top of a staircase; the perfect hostess he called her (she had cried over it in her bedroom), she had the makings of a perfect hostess, he said.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/5/dalloway.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Naomi Bardoff</i></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can say anything we like about Peter's ulterior motives, internal inconsistencies, or poverty of viewpoint. The fact will remain that his criticisms present a problem for Clarissa. Woolf herself wrote a friend while working on <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> that she feared Clarissa might be \u201ctoo stiff, too glittering and tinsely.\u201d A false face and a trivial, make-believe life\u2014isn't it exactly so?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we are to find a defense for her, I think it will lie in her very separation from life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does she like so much about parties?</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>[\u2026] the colors, tones, salts of existence, so that she filled the room she entered, and felt often as she stood hesitating one moment on the threshold of her drawing-room, an exquisite suspense, such as might stay a diver before plunging while the sea darkens and brightens beneath him, and the waves which threaten to break, but only gently split their surface, roll and conceal and encrust as they just turn over the weeds with pearl.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Curiously enough, it is the moment before a party that she likes best. Clarissa has a keen awareness of her own subjectivity\u2014of the places and times where she stands at the limit of life. Looking out windows, hesitating in doorways, even in the middle of a busy street:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>She would not say of any one in the world now that they were this or that. She felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged. She sliced like a knife through everything; at the same time was outside, looking on. She had a perpetual sense, as she watched the taxi cabs, of being out, out, far out to sea and alone; she always had the feeling that it was very, very dangerous to live even one day.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cShe would not say of Peter, would not say of herself, I am this, I am that.\u201d She refuses her own individuality, disperses herself, to join an eternity. In detaching herself from her own particularity, she allows herself to see life as a whole, in contrast with non-life; she takes life on the whole as an object of passion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the middle of her party, after hearing of Septimus Smith who has killed himself, she pulls away, she looks out the window\u2014</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>She parted the curtains; she looked. Oh, but how surprising!\u2014in the room opposite the old lady stared straight at her! [...] She was going to bed, in the room opposite. It was fascinating to watch her, moving about, that old lady, crossing the room, coming to the window. Could she see her? It was fascinating, with people still laughing and shouting in the drawing-room, to watch that old woman, quite quietly, going to bed. She pulled the blind now. The clock began striking. The young man had killed himself; but she did not pity him; with the clock striking the hour, one, two, three, she did not pity him, with all this going on. There! the old lady had put out her light! the whole house was dark now with this going on, she repeated, and the words came to her, Fear no more the heat of the sun. She must go back to them. But what an extraordinary night! She felt somehow very like him\u2014the young man who had killed himself. She felt glad that he had done it; thrown it away. The clock was striking. The leaden circles dissolved in the air. He made her feel the beauty; made her feel the fun. But she must go back.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The old woman, and the man who had killed himself, both on the outer edge of the tumult of life, make her aware of life\u2019s beauty. It seems that some new happening, some new reality, comes into being here at the limits. Standing in the space between life and non-life, Clarissa opens herself to a new thing entirely, something eternal, something sublime; something that can only be experienced by herself, in private moments, and only by disengaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus her defense. \u201cThe moment of importance comes not here but there,\u201d the author would say; a little change in focus and Clarissa\u2019s experience of life seems not so trivial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And in dispersing herself, in denying her own qualities, she, too, becomes a part of it all. Peter, her great skeptic, despairing that she is not a thing to hold tightly in the palm of his hand, can\u2019t deny that she is nonetheless a thing of some kind\u2014one that burrows into the heart. She evades his accusations and returns to make contact with him in another way.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Ah, said St. Margaret\u2019s, like a hostess who comes into her drawing-room on the very stroke of the hour and finds her guests there already. I am not late. No, it is precisely half-past eleven, she says. Yet, though she is perfectly right, her voice, being the voice of the hostess, is reluctant to inflict its individuality. Some grief for the past holds it back; some concern for the present. It is half-past eleven, she says, and the sound of St. Margaret\u2019s glides into the recesses of the heart and buries itself in ring after ring of sound, like something alive which wants to confide itself, to disperse itself, to be, with a tremor of delight, at rest\u2014like Clarissa herself, thought Peter Walsh, coming down the stairs on the stroke of the hour in white. It is Clarissa herself, he thought, with a deep emotion, and extraordinarily clear, yet puzzling, recollection of her, as if this bell had come into the room years ago, where they sat at some moment of great intimacy, and had gone from one to the other and had left, like a bee with honey, laden with the moment.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus can she ensure her presence in its clarity\u2014not by confessing or by inflicting but by gliding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real things turn up in the strangest places and in unexpected ways.</p>\r\n",

Lauren Berlant's<a href=\"#ft1\" name=\"id1\"><sup>1</sup></a>  attempts to engage these constraints through the lens of affect, sensibility, and consciousness open novel and refreshing ways of getting to know our present. These modes of engagement in turn demand an encounter with forms of political practice and the quest for practical forms of getting un-stuck, getting beyond the present. In other words, this process of getting to know our present is also a process of asking what to do about it. How can we fantasize a new reality? How can we overcome our attachments to lives that don't work? And how can we build a pathway to something new and better?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>\r\nEarl McCabe: You wrote in \u201cStarved\u201d that you were writing from a position of \u201cdepressive realism,\u201d whereby you attempted to sit \u201caround a thing\u201d for a while instead of moving beyond it. Can you elaborate on what you mean by depressive realism? Are you still writing from this position?\r\n</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLauren Berlant: Is this the beginning of our interview? We need some context, I think. I\u2019ve spent my career thinking about collective life as a sensed scene of affective projection and attachment, tracking how there comes to be such a sense across political, aesthetic, and everyday life registers. I\u2019ve been interested in how being-in-common has developed, affected, and been stamped by normative and juridical activity while also generating affective infrastructures on the ground that take up quite a different shape than, and come to accompany and sometimes interfere with, the official and the normative. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis is what I mean by \u201csentimentality\u201d when I say that I\u2019ve written a \u201cnational sentimentality\u201d trilogy. Sentimentality is not just the mawkish, nostalgic, and simpleminded mode with which it\u2019s conventionally associated, where people identify with wounds of saturated longing and suffering, and it\u2019s not just a synonym for a theatre of empathy: it is a mode of relationality in which people take emotions to express something authentic about themselves that they think the world should welcome and respect; a mode constituted by affective and emotional intelligibility and a kind of generosity, recognition, and solidarity among strangers. Another way to say this is that I am interested in a realist account of fantasy, insofar as the political and the social are floated by complex and historically specific affective investments. How do we learn to attach to (to identify the very sinews of our self-continuity with) abstractions like the nation form, the law, sexual identity, capitalism, and so on? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe essay \u201cStarved\u201d is about why people, including sexuality theorists, have tended to talk about relationality and kinship rather than remaining in the room with the idealization/perturbation/aversion for which sex itself inevitably and so complexly stands. \u201cDepressive realism\u201d is a phrase from psychoanalysis. I learned it from Andrew Solomon\u2019s <i>The Noonday Demon</i>, which is an account of his depression in relation to other people\u2019s accounts of it and theories of it. Solomon writes there that most people self-idealize, imagining themselves to be more beautiful and more efficacious than they are: and he says that this kind of self-optimism is genuinely adaptive. Depressive realists, in contrast, are more accurate: their sense of realism isn\u2019t dark or tragic, but less defended against taking in the awkwardness and difficulty of living on in the world. So when I said I write as a depressive realist, I meant that I see awkwardness, incoherence, and the difficulty of staying in sync with the world at the heart of what also binds people to the social. What doesn\u2019t work, makes no sense, or is ungainly always accompanies fantasies of the good life, and other clarifying genres of optimism, and the question of fantasy is centrally about how it helps people remain attached to worlds and situations (and find ways of thriving within them) that are also quite toxic, difficult, infelicitous, or just messy. I look at the ways people bear how life proceeds without guarantees. This positioning\u2014as my blog and my next book, <i>Cruel Optimism</i> (2011), argue\u2014asks \u201cWhy do people stay attached to lives that don\u2019t work?\u201d There, I am not interested centrally in asking how they <i>could</i> work, first; I am interested in how fantasies of belonging clash with the conditions of belonging in particular historical moments. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDepressive realism allows for an account of the utility of fantasy in maintaining but also imagining alternative modes of life. <i>Cruel Optimism</i> tells some pretty difficult stories about how people maintain their footing in worlds that are not there for them. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>EM: I find your focus on affect as a force of reproducing present ways of life very exciting. There are however many other ways of thinking about this reproduction, the orthodox Marxist perspective looks for agentive domination by the bourgeois class (this quest for an intentional class seems to be shared by many on the right as well), an economistic perspective would ground the stability of the contemporary upon objective constraints on possibility determined by economic forms (i.e. people can\u2019t stop working because then they can\u2019t eat), or there could be a naturalistic account based on evolutionary psychological research on basic human nature (altruism is inherently limited because some Stanford students behaved badly on camera). Why do you think that investigating affective and emotional rhythms of attachment is such an important, if not superior, way to tell the story of the persistence of the present?</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLB: I learned my affect theory first not from psychoanalysis or aesthetics but from Marx and Luk\u00e1cs and Raymond Williams, etc., so I don\u2019t think your version of these alternative materialist or organicist explanations (I know you were being efficient) tells the whole story of any of them insofar as the dynamics they highlight here seem unrelated to each other as reifications of cause and effect. I am always interested in a methodology that tracks the overdetermination of an object/scene/relation that appears to us: so my tendency is to read widely and across disciplines.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn any case, Marxist cultural theory argues that the historical sense, the collective sense of the historical present, presents itself first affectively and then through mediations that help or induce people to navigate worlds whose materiality is overdetermined by many processes (means of production, social relations of production, normative traditions, etc.). Mediation shapes experience and imaginaries. For me, the focus on mediation links the aesthetic and the normatively social. The investment in certain forms for providing the continuity of life goes some way to explaining the stickiness of some kinds of injustice, inequality, and energy-siphoning that structure so much of the reproduction of life. It\u2019s not a project about the ways feeling bad (tired from work, disaffected from being exploited, alienated from most strangers and intimates) is distracted from by feel-good fantasy, but the ways that fantasies of the good life themselves remediate (contribute new forms to) realist accounts of causality and of the social. I argue that affect theory, in this sense, is another phase in the history of ideology theory.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut there are other motives too. I have long been engaged in sexuality studies, which I have seen as bound up in material ways with comprehending the work of the nation form and capital at the point of production and consumption. Subjectification, subjectivization: how are the infrastructural activities of capital expressed in practice, experience, and subjectivity? How do the instabilities of sexual non-sovereignty work in proximity to the social, economic, and political ones? How does normative labor-related subjectivity (see the neoliberal entrepreneurial subject who sees gaming the system as freedom and autonomy; see the social democratic model of limited collective upward mobility) relate to the reproduction of heteronormativity in its molecular forms? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, you mention the history of the present. Marxist historians tend to disrespect the present because political, social, and economic complexities are masked by appearance, and everyone disrespects \u201cpresentism\u201d as a kind of shallow parochialism. I became an Americanist partly because, while teaching American literature in the United States, I discovered that my students thought they were learning something ontological about the United States\u2014so I had to alienate the object, show it in its complexity as a magnet both of practices and fantasies, and think about the relation of those. The same goes for the historical present. It needs to find genres that enable its inhabitants to assess the relation of event to effect, of domination to creative life practices, of normativity to social imaginaries. I take that to be a central function of critical theory, art, and whatever work understands itself to be making a present from within it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/5/berlant.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Tom Tian</i></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>EM: Could you elaborate a little more on the concept of \u201cnormativity?\u201d Where did it come from, and why do you think it has such analytic purchase? How does it relate to the \u201crealist accounts of causality and of the social\u201d that fantasy remediates?</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLB: It comes to queer theory through Foucault by way of Georges Canguilhem, <i>The Normal and the Pathological</i>. Its importance to me and Michael Warner was to think not just about the statistical norm or the moral/conventional norm but the practices on which conventional modes of social intelligibility rest that become naturalized and moralized. Judith Butler calls them regulative norms. They govern by standing for common sense, by providing a tacit or seemingly foundational sense of scale and appropriateness for collective life. We wanted to call the regime of sexuality under which we currently live heteronormativity rather than heterosexuality, in \u201cSex in Public,\u201d because the point wasn\u2019t to attack people with a particular pattern of object choice but the whole social regime propped on that pattern, which saturates the fantasy of the good life so thoroughly and in so many domains of social existence that its very robustness seemed to atrophy the skills for imagining alternative social and economic relations and institutions of intimacy, let alone what it means when we identify with any pattern of desire. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn those days, as now, people tended to see sexuality as cordoned off from the infrastructure of nationality and capitalism; they tended to see its appearance in those contexts as a scandal rather than as a revelation of an ongoing situation. Suturing normativity to heterosexuality was an attempt to remedy that, as well as an attempt to continue integrating radical political critique with a sex positivity that was not pastoral, that did not subtract the dangerousness and strangeness of sex.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI am seriously opposed to the reproduction of erotophobia; I am seriously for dismantling heteronormative economic and legal hegemony. But the aim is not to blast heterosexuality out of existence; it is to make it merely one patterning among many. But as there is no collective life without norms, the question isn\u2019t how to become post-normative as such but how to respond to the urgency to engender other kinds of anchors or magnets for new social relations and modes of life. The psychoanalysts talk about the inevitability of \u201ctaking up a position\u201d within a normative structure but in my view the project of detaching from toxic norms that bind the social to itself in its dominant mode reveals how dynamic the normative reproduction of life is both in subjective and structural terms. Bifo Berardi talks about neoliberalism as a response to increasingly powerful demands by workers for social equality and democracy (and there is no equality in capitalist terms); likewise the \u201cculture wars\u201d are responses to the emancipatory activity of people of color, migrants, and sexualized subjects. All of those responses have had serious structural consequences politically and economically and in the sensoriums of the beings affected by them. So it matters to fight for better normative representations of the social, not just because they provide the affective satisfaction of being-in-common but because they affect the very infrastructure that organizes time, health, care, intimacy...\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b>EM: Going back to my alternative materialist and organicist explanations, I appreciate your criticism and I meant them to only be caricatures. I was trying to bring out a difficulty, or at least unfamiliarity, that many have with your emphasis on politics in the symbolic realm as opposed to material concerns. For example, discussions around the labor movement today predominantly focus on the ways that unions impact wages, benefits, and financial flexibility, and less on the production of solidarity or class consciousness. In contrast to this you stated in your interview with <i>Variant</i> magazine that, \u201cDeveloping symbolic practical infrastructures for alternativity is the task of progressive praxis.\u201d Why do you (or in fact do you) think that the notion of \u201csymbolic practical infrastructures\u201d is so alien to dominant discourse? To what extent do you think your emphasis changes the forms of political practices you endorse? Are there any recent developments in Left practice you find particularly promising?</b>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLB: This question is too big for me really to respond to fully here. What I\u2019m gesturing toward is this: what is the purpose of critically engaged thought and practice that emerges not in a reformist mode\u2014e.g. is trying to make the currently dominant relational infrastructures less bad for more people\u2014but in a radical one, with the aim of providing what Deleuze would call genuinely new \u201cplanes of consistency,\u201d modes of movement that shift the terms and therefore social and subjective potentialities. Now, I\u2019m more vulgar and materialist, in that I don\u2019t distinguish as much as some people do between conceptual models of being in common and the work of staying in sync that sociality involves, work that includes the syncope, the falling away from being bound to the social and sensing one\u2019s belonging. So a \u201csymbolic practical infrastructure\u201d straddles the conceptual and material organization of life: It tracks what the impact of a concept (any field of relation that looks like an object would count here) could have on the work of living, which is simultaneously material (the reproduction of life as the struggles of politics) and fantasmatic (ideas of the political and the collective in relation to fantasies of agency, sociality and life-making). \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI would want it to be our critical work to make alternativity imaginable, which includes livable; to induce glitches in the reproduction of the relation of effect to event, of cause to effect, of value to labor of all kinds. I would want to aim to remediate equality as a radically alive contingent relation and not just a process of authoritarian inversion (the story of who\u2019s on top and who\u2019s dominated). I don\u2019t want to presume that x relation leads to y or is expressed in y; my aim is not to conclude that the totality has this shape or that; I want to see what\u2019s to be made of the dynamic relation between the predictable and unpredictable (capitalism has its own genres of instability, after all, which is what makes it such a powerful inducer of existence, because it can absorb its own contradictions\u2014until it can\u2019t, as at the present moment). I would want our work to refigure the relation of prehension (grabbing history) and apprehension (organizing the potential for new developments) by attending both to the variations that \u201cmanage the situation\u201d and the variations that open up other ways to carve out modes of sociality. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy analogy is often to return to the socialist feminism of the second wave: it wasn\u2019t just a scene of solidarity based on critique of the political economy of the family or patriarchy, but was a genuine effort at imagining other living forms of relation and value transecting economy and intimacy. The autonomists are now doing this work of material/visceral organization, as are the queer activists, and the anarchists too, and it\u2019s all really exciting, the amount of genre-transgression and genre-invention that\u2019s going on behalf of reinventing what it means to have a life. This distinguishes them from the parts of the labor movement that were imagining expanding the middle class in such a way that reproduced the poor as the outside of democracy (which is what happens when people misrecognize capitalist modes of entrepreneurial subjectivity that\u2019s trying to game the system as practices of equality and evidence of freedom). But the new social movements are not presuming prosperity, property, accumulation, and kinship as the grounds for making life. Reinventing work and care, they\u2019re also attempting to change the affective resonance around dependency. In neoliberal normativity, to be dependent is to be non-sovereign: but in the era of austerity, it is the first step to solidarity. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"longhr\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<footnote>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nLauren Berlant is the George M.

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\n<h3>1</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the years before he wrote his great trilogy, <i>Molloy</i>, <i>Malone Dies</i> and <i>The Unnamable</i>, Samuel Beckett composed a series of imagined conversations between himself and a friend of his, George Duthuit, in which they discussed three contemporary painters. This work, <i>Three Dialogues</i>, begins as follows:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Beckett</span>: Total object, complete with missing parts, instead of partial object. Question of degree.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nBeckett elaborates:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Beckett</span>: By nature I mean here, like the na\u00efvest realist, a composite of perceiver and perceived, not a datum, an experience. All I wish to suggest is that the tendency and accomplishment of this painting are fundamentally those of previous painting, straining to enlarge the statement of a compromise.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\u201cA question of degree,\u201d \u201cthe statement of a compromise\u201d\u2014this observation on the painter Tal Coat may be taken as Beckett\u2019s wry comment on all those modernisms of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century which took as their task the full, rich expression of human experience. The novels of Joyce and Woolf, for example, which cleave close to the inner lives of their characters in an effort to watch the world blossom out through the open mind\u2014in an effort, in Beckett\u2019s words, to include the \u201ctotal object, complete with missing parts\u201d\u2014merely a matter of degree, a better representation of reality, perhaps, an advance in technique to be sure, but one which, in Beckett\u2019s view, misses something.\r\n</p> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPushed by his frustrated interlocutor to explain what more he could possibly want from a work of art, he elaborates:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Beckett</span>: [...] What we have to consider in the case of [traditional painters] is not that they surveyed the world with the eyes of building-contractors, a mere means like any other, but that they never stirred from the field of the possible, however much they may have enlarged it. The only thing disturbed by the revolutionaries Matisse and Tal Coat is a certain order on the plane of the feasible.<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Duthuit</span>: What other plane can there be for the maker?<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Beckett</span>: Logically none. Yet I speak of an art turning from it in disgust, weary of puny exploits, weary of pretending to be able, of being able, of doing a little better the same old thing, of going a little further along a dreary road.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIn the vast treasure-house of ways and means, bright colors and apt phrases with which the history of literature has revealed the human world, Beckett finds something missing: failure. The art which brings worlds to light doesn\u2019t want to know what will always remain in darkness; it doesn\u2019t want to hear of the impossible. Beckett asks, almost paradoxically, for an art which would be\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThe expression that there is nothing to express, nothing with which to express, nothing from which to express, no power to express, no desire to express, together with the obligation to express.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nTwo questions are posed here: First, why is it obligatory to express? Second, how can it be impossible?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>2</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPerhaps Beckett\u2019s novels may be taken as a wry riposte to the sentiment expressed in Joan Didion\u2019s line, \u201cWe tell ourselves stories in order to live.\u201d This phrase has been quoted to death because it expresses in succinct form a theory of fiction which, for whatever reason, comes naturally to us these days: fiction is a sort of lie, but an essential sort, since it organizes the dull incoherence of ordinary suffering by impressing it with what one might for lack of a better word call meaning. Language, the work of naming and giving form, cannot cure us of suffering, but it provides palliative care, catharsis or working-through to render it bearable.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBeckett shows that such a view lets language off the hook rather too easily. After all, what else are we sick of? The endless internal monologue, what\u2019s going on, how do I feel, what can I do, what shall I do, why this, why that and the other, isn\u2019t this the recalcitrant and ubiquitous substance of ordinary suffering? Behind our species\u2019 many estimable accomplishments looms the single massive incapacity so well diagnosed by Pascal: \u201cAll of man\u2019s misfortune comes from one thing, which is not knowing how to sit quietly in a room.\u201d Emphasis on the quietly. A man who achieved in this sphere the degree of proficiency with which housecats are endowed would be a kind of saint. And to what do we owe this daily misfortune but language? The capacity to name, to describe, to endlessly repeat with more or mostly less accuracy the world of things, to account for ourselves and give risibly delusory reasons for our every incomprehensible move, isn\u2019t this more obligation than ability and more disease than cure? We live a good deal of the time in more or less explicit flight from a sort of insomniac\u2019s boredom which always threatens to veer off into anxiety, eyes wide open and wishing only to sleep, having nothing to say and unable to stop saying. Even absent more earthly sources of dysphoria, this restless ghost in our machine would surely suffice to guarantee our collective unhappiness.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is a fact, then, that we must express, must speak, describe and explain. This is not quite all, however, for such speech is endowed with an inherent and mysterious teleology: we must say properly, express well, know and give the right reasons. We are obligated to tell the truth about ourselves, at least to ourselves; we must get it right. It is this aim which renders the fact of ceaseless speech into an obligation: the obligation is to say once and for all, to say the truth about what happened and why in order to be able to be silent, to forget. We tell stories, then, in order to have done with stories. We speak in order to die\u2014or to be born.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>3</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSamuel Beckett\u2019s 1951 novel <i>Molloy</i> is split down the middle. The first part is the story of Molloy\u2019s life as written by Molloy the old man, a formerly wandering hobo who is now confined to a bed awaiting death. It opens with the protagonist\u2019s efforts to mount a bicycle (a difficult task, since his legs are too stiff to bend at the knees, and one described at some length). When he\u2019s aboard, he proceeds to ride the bicycle into town, where he rests astride his bike with his head in his hands. He is immediately accosted by a policeman:\r\n\t<blockquote>\r\n\tWhat are you doing here? he said. I\u2019m used to that question, I understood it immediately. Resting, I said. Resting, he said. Resting, I said. Will you answer my question? he cried. So it always is when I\u2019m reduced to confabulation, I honestly believe I have answered the question I am asked and in reality I do nothing of the kind. I won\u2019t reconstruct the conversation in all its meanderings. It ended in my understanding that my way of resting, my attitude when at rest, astride my bicycle, my arms on the handlebars, my head on my arms, was a violation of I don\u2019t know what, public order, public decency.\r\n\t</blockquote>\r\nMolloy is hauled off to the police station, but he\u2019s not the sort to complain: he acknowledges the policeman\u2019s point, he really is a violation of decency.\r\n\t<blockquote>\r\n\tWhat is certain is this, that I never rested in that way again, my feet obscenely resting on the earth, my arms on the handlebars and on my arms my head, rocking and abandoned. It is indeed a deplorable sight, a deplorable example, for the people, who so need to be encouraged, in their bitter toil, and to have before their eyes manifestations of strength, only, of courage and of joy, without which they might collapse, at the end of the day, and roll on the ground.\r\n\t</blockquote>\r\nBut he himself is scarcely to blame, since though he does his best, avoiding this sort of public obscenity requires an education he was never lucky enough to receive:\r\n\t<blockquote>\r\n\tAs far as good will is concerned, I had it to overflowing... so that my repertory of permitted attitudes has never ceased to grow, from my first steps until my last, executed last year. And if I have always behaved like a pig, the fault lies not with me but with my superiors, who corrected me only on points of detail instead of showing me the essence of the system, after the manner of the great English schools, and the guiding principles of good manners, and how to proceed, without going wrong, from the former to the latter, and how to trace back to its ultimate source a given comportment. For that would have allowed me, before parading in public certain habits such as the finger in the nose, the scratching of the balls, digital emunction and the peripatetic piss, to refer them to the first rules of a reasoned theory. On this subject I had only negative and empirical notions, which means that I was in the dark, most of the time, and all the more completely as a lifetime of observations had left me doubting the possibility of systematic decorum, even within a limited area. But it is only since I have ceased to live that I think of these things and the other things. It is in the tranquility of decomposition that I remember the long confused emotion which was my life, and that I judge it, as it is said that God will judge me, and with no less impertinence.\r\n\t</blockquote>\r\nThis episode contains much of Beckett\u2019s theory of the novel, or rather his attack on the novel\u2014first of all in the policeman\u2019s original question, which in Beckett\u2019s world is how writing begins. In most novels we can answer with complete confidence the question of what the characters are doing, why they\u2019re doing it, how they came to be here, and this epistemological homelikeness is one of the pleasures of reading, because of course life is not so luxurious with its reasons. In life, the question of just what exactly you think you\u2019re doing here is liable to bring you to a complete staring halt before its impossibility. Yet it seems necessary to have such an answer\u2014the police are, as it were, always present\u2014and so you begin to confabulate.<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMolloy\u2019s wish for a systematic decorum, and his skepticism about the possibility of such a system, say the same thing another way: it\u2019s a question of the reasoned justification for the disposition of one\u2019s body, of reasons to clothe the body with. But the body is stiff, or weary, it eats and sucks and shits, and such a demand is laughable. Beckett likes to place his characters in situations of radical physical constraint\u2014in <i>Endgame</i> two of the characters are in trashcans, in <i>Happiness</i> they find themselves buried up to their necks in a hill\u2014and this emphasis on the trivial but omnipresent troubles of physicality renders prominent the almost total absence of such troubles from the history of the novel. In most novels the disposition of the body is merely a metaphor for the disposition of its soul; in Beckett the body shows up as a machine in its own right, breaking down constantly, in need of management.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOddly, though, Beckett is never more comforting, never warmer and funnier, than when he describes the physical decay of his characters. They are peripatetic cripples nearly to the man, and they keep going nonetheless. When they can\u2019t walk they hobble, when they can\u2019t hobble they crawl, when they can\u2019t crawl they drag themselves along the ground by grabbing at the underbrush ahead of them, and when they can\u2019t manage that anymore they roll along the ground in great graceful arcs. They are deterred neither by their deep uncertainty about where they want to go nor by the manifest impossibility, given physical limitations, of ever getting there. They are endowed with a technical resourcefulness made comically futile by their physical decay and a kind of bloody-minded persistence which has nothing to do with courage. Beckett\u2019s admiration for this quality in human beings\u2014it is, I think, what he loves best in us\u2014echoes Melville\u2019s: what could be more touching in us than the craft and madness with which we project our puny bodies out over the deep, toward futile goals or none at all? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMolloy\u2019s crippled body functions, then, as a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the kind of misanthropy and Weltschmerz which complains of humans\u2019 contingency, the \u201cabsurdity\u201d of their position, their ignorance of death. Nothing is more encouraging than the way human beings take such false problems in stride and hobble along despite them. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>4</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe problem lies elsewhere, as Molloy notes as he\u2019s getting under way:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nIt came back to my mind, from nowhere, as a moment before my name, that I had set out to see my mother, at the beginning of this ending day. My reasons? I had forgotten them. But I knew them, I must have known them, I had only to find them again and I would sweep, with the clipped wings of necessity, to my mother. Yes, it\u2019s all easy when you know why, a mere matter of magic. Yes, the whole thing is to know what saint to implore, any fool can implore him. For the particulars, if you are interested in particulars, there is no need to despair, you may scrabble on the right door, in the right way, in the end. It\u2019s for the whole there seems to be no spell. Perhaps there is no whole, before you\u2019re dead.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nBy reducing the physical capacities and aims of his characters to a bare minimum\u2014they can do nothing more than keep moving, and they seem to desire little else\u2014Beckett lets us see another, deeper problem. Getting from one place to another, getting around, is merely unspeakably difficult; this is not a disaster. It is reasons, accounts, and (hence) speech that are, properly speaking, impossible, and it is from this fact that his narrators suffer. To write is, as Molloy says, an impertinence: \u201cIt is in the tranquility of decomposition that I remember the long confused emotion which was my life, and that I judge it, as it is said that God will judge me, and with no less impertinence.\u201d He adds: \u201cTo decompose is to live too, I know, I know, don\u2019t torment me, but one sometimes forgets.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNietzsche writes, in <i>Twilight of the Idols</i>: \u201cThe value of life cannot be estimated: not by the living, for they are interested parties; and not by the dead, for another reason.\u201d Beckett suggests that in writing something like a judgment, a final accounting, is always at stake; to write is to know where the story begins and where it ends, to be out beyond the \u201clong confused emotion that was my life.\u201d For a god to assume such a position would be frankly impertinent\u2014what, after all, does he know about it? For a human, it is simply impossible. One is never dead enough to write. The narrators of <i>Molloy</i>, <i>Malone Dies</i> and <i>The Unnamable</i> are all half-dead, and they all long for death, but none are dead enough to write, and so none can ever finish. The narrator of <i>The Unnamable</i>, for example, is under the strange delusion that if he merely manages to speak truly about himself, if he finds the right words or the right formula, he will be allowed to die. It\u2019s a telling illusion, but it isn\u2019t of course true: the end of the story isn\u2019t the end of life, one never reaches the end of the story, one simply dies. Likewise, the narrator of <i>Malone</i> plans throughout the book to write an inventory of his few remaining possessions, a sort of testament, but of course he can\u2019t do it until the very end, when he\u2019s sure that he won\u2019t lose or gain anything more, that the list will be final. Of course he never writes it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMolloy, who spends more or less the whole book digressing from his search for his mother, finds her eventually, as we know from the outset: he writes from his mother\u2019s room, lying in the very bed where she lay before her death. His quest\u2014the only thing he does for a reason in his long, meandering life\u2014is to find his mother, to get back before the beginning, to the origin of reasons, and as a matter of fact he gets there. He comes to rest and begins to write. But his success is a failure, even a disaster; it is possible to move, to get somewhere, but it is not possible to find the beginning or achieve the end. He writes and cannot stop writing and cannot write. Beckett\u2019s novels wander a wide circuit, but they recur to this problem\u2014the failure of their narrators, the failure of writing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>5</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWell, and what of it? What are we supposed to \u201cget\u201d from a book about not writing a book? That Beckett\u2019s novels have nothing to do with the pallid introversion of self-conscious formalism, no reader will doubt; the impossibility we encounter here is by no means a parochial problem of the novelist. This makes the question all the more pressing: if one must fail, why call attention to it?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBeckett is sometimes read as a sort of existentialist, associated with Camus and Sartre\u2014presenting the dark truth of finitude to us so that, knowing it, we will be freed to live in its light. Such a project may perhaps be adequate to the problem of death; it is facile with regard to Beckett\u2019s problem, that of expression. Beckett\u2019s narrators know very well the ridiculousness of telling stories, and this in no sense frees them from the task of doing so. As long as there is speech and reason, there remains the task of achieving clarity and speaking well, and this task does not disappear. Merely revealing it would do nothing, a fact of which the Beckett of <i>Three Dialogues</i> is keenly aware:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Duthuit</span>: But might it not be suggested... that [the work] is expressive of the impossibility to express?<br />\r\n<span class=\"dark\">Beckett</span>: No more ingenious method could be devised for restoring [the artist], safe and sound, to the bosom of Saint Luke. But let us, for once, be foolish enough not to turn tail. All have turned wisely tail, before the ultimate penury, back to the mere misery where destitute virtuous mothers may steal bread for their starving brats. There is more than a difference of degree between being short, short of the world, short of self, and being without these esteemed commodities. The one is a predicament, the other not.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nWhat might it mean to complete one\u2019s destitution here? Particularly given that the task of expression will not disappear?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe answer is suggested by <i>Molloy</i>\u2019s second narrator, Moran. While Molloy is off seeking his mother, Moran is seeking Molloy. Moran is some sort of private investigator in the pay of a mysterious boss, ordered to seek out various individuals for obscure reasons. At the beginning of his story, Moran as a narrator presents a painful contrast to Molloy; while Molloy\u2019s story is an unbroken stream of obscure digressions and half-thought jokes (no paragraph breaks for a hundred pages), Moran\u2019s prose is painfully clear and correct, full of explanations and reasons of the most mundane kind. Moran will tell you why he chose, on that particular day, to wear boots instead of loafers; Molloy scarcely knows if he\u2019s naked. Molloy knows judgment to be an impertinence, while Moran is a man of judgment; on the pleasures of leisure, he has this to say:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nI\u2019ve always loved doing nothing [...] Seeing something done which I could have done better myself, if I had wished, and did do better whenever I put my mind to it, I had the impression of discharging a function to which no form of activity could have exalted me.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nMoran can assume such a position, can write clearly, because he has a boss, and because he does not ask too many questions. His boss is utterly mysterious, they have never met, he does not know the reasons for his orders or what they result in, or whether he is part of a large organization or the sole investigator. He simply receives verbal orders and carries them out to the letter. The problems of expression are handled elsewhere, above his pay grade. Moran is an observant if somewhat hypocritical Catholic.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe is such a man until he sets out on foot after Molloy. A week into his quest his knee goes stiff, he can barely walk, and he finds he cannot complete his task. He is forced into an idleness which is no longer that of judgment but that of impotence, and something breaks in him. Something breaks in his prose, too\u2014his reasons flee, and what replaces them, the shocked wonder into which he descends, is strangely beautiful. The contingency of his body\u2019s weakness somehow releases him.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI cannot quite describe what makes the end of <i>Molloy</i> quietly revelatory, but I would like to remark on one moment toward the end of the book, as Moran hobbles slowly home. He asks himself what it is he thought of while he was dragging himself, at a rate of ten paces a day, for months, toward his house. He answers that he thought a great deal about the bees he keeps; he had been watching their dances. He explains that every element of the dance seems to have a meaning\u2014not only the figures danced, but the sound made, the height at which the dance occurs, the time of day... It\u2019s endlessly signifying. But of course he has no idea what it means, and can never know. Moran plans, when he arrives, to continue his observations, to live out his days as a watcher of bees:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nAnd I admitted with good grace the possibility that this dance was after all no better than the dances of the people of the West, frivolous and meaningless. But for me, sitting near my sun-drenched hives, it would always be a noble thing to contemplate, too noble ever to be sullied by the cogitations of a man like me, exiled in his manhood. And I would never do my bees the wrong I had done my God, to whom I had been taught to ascribe my angers, fears, desires, and even my body.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nMoran finds here a significance that he will never grasp, that he will never get right or almost right or entirely wrong, and in this sees not an excuse to abandon it but a freedom to remain in effort, in exile, at peace, to continue looking. It\u2019s a strange, small, signifying version of the Kantian sublime: what draws us because we cannot master it, because we are free from our efforts at mastery.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBeckett wishes in <i>Three Dialogues</i> \u201cto admit that to be an artist is to fail, as no other dare fail, that failure is his world and the shrink from it desertion, art and craft, good housekeeping, living.\u201d To acknowledge failure is not to be freed from effort, not at all, effort is only human. If there is something to be gained from knowing that one\u2019s efforts to speak the world are doomed to failure, Molloy suggests that it is the capacity to maintain oneself in the space of incomprehension, the capacity not to flee\u2014in short, the capacity for wonder. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n<div class=\"footnote\"><p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nA friend of mine recalls that as a child she was always afraid that if she were accused of a murder she would certainly be convicted, because she would never have an alibi: she would never be able to account for her time, to provide a convincing account of where she was on the evening of June 5th, because much of her time was spent in unaccountable drifting.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

            "rendered_content": "<h3>I.</h3>\r\n<p>I spent this past winter being a sad community organizer.</p>\r\n<p>I stared out from bus stops and CTA platforms six days a week, commuting from Hyde Park to Chinatown in the Chicago winter. My office was in a three-story titanium building. Everyone smiled at each other all the time.</p>\r\n<p>\u201cI don't know if I can keep doing a job that's so irrelevant to the fact that I'm depressed,\u201d I joked to my friend Austin a few weeks into the job. It was true: I'd never had to be so efficient while being such an emotional wreck (privilege). I was a recent college graduate. The corporate mode of relating with people, where you communicate so that you can help each other administrate, the logistical mode of relating, was really hard and alienating. Plus I was <i>the organizer,</i> which meant that I was supposed to be a leader\u2014radiant with positivity.</p>\r\n<p>I'm not sure if depressed community organizing is impossible in general (although see <a href = http://bit.ly/gcmaui>TWENTY REASONS</a> by Feel Tank Chicago), but it was impossible under the Organize for America-influenced model of electoral organizing used by my organization. Among other things, the model we used demanded a spectacle of certainty and enthusiasm, through which any exhaustion, depression, or doubt could surface only as a secret or open secret. This makes some sense.</p>\r\n<p>Still, the environment felt so oppressive\u2014the workday bustled briskly forward by the smiling efficiency of three hundred pragmatic employees\u2014that I fantasized about \u201ccoming out\u201d to my coworkers as \u201cdepressed.\u201d Here's an email I wrote at the time:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\ni feel like i want to come out to my coworkers and other people as depressed. the idea makes me happier. like right now i am this moody person who is an outsider, but if i came out to them as being depressed it would be more legible to them why. and it would be like, this is a fact about my subjectivity that might be different from your subjectivity. and it's kind of like any coming out, right, like eve sedgwick coming out as a fat person, it's like probably they already can tell that i'm depressed, or at least a little bit, otherwise why do i show up at work and sort of glare and sort of shut myself in my office. but then it could circulate.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>but i don't know. it's probably less risky than coming out as a gay person? but still risky. like would they stop trusting me. or would they feel annoyed at me, or sort of not believe in being depressed as a real thing, or sort of feel like i am a sick person and always try to make me feel better. like no, i just want being depressed to be part of who i am, something that i may or may not get over eventually, but something that other people who treat me have to respect and deal with. and maybe it means, like, i want them to ask me questions and check in with me about being depressed. and i want to be able to tell them, like, yeah, it takes me two hours to leave my apartment every morning because all i can do is stare at a point on the floor and listen to jewel. and sometimes it is impossible for me to do my work. but there are ways for me to still do my work, it is just different from someone who isn't depressed or who is less depressed.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not a story of how capitalism caused the attrition of my subjectivity, since I was working for a non-profit and doing political work. Except that it kind of is that story, because the model of work we used was profoundly market-based (being more efficient, getting more volunteers, making more contacts, getting more votes, for what? \u201cPower.\u201d). In this environment, what was more difficult than feeling sad was the feeling that sadness had to take on the status of a private extravagance, that there was no room for my sadness while there was work to be done and people to lead. If there was room for my sadness, it would only be to <i>fix it</i> in the name of greater productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/5/debbie.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Claire Bidwell</i></center></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>II. What's political about moods?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I introduce this anecdote as a practical/personal/political framework for thinking about what's important about the work of writers of sadness such as Rachel Glaser (in case you don't know who she is, I'll introduce her later), Lydia Davis, Tao Lin, and Mary Gaitskill. I'm interested in reading their work as a kind of realism about sadness. I think that these writers and others are trying to do the imaginative work of creating space in the world for people to be lost and feel bad, to create a form that can hold dull feeling and make the dull feeling interesting again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The political importance of these texts, for me, lies in their generous treatment of emotion. In this political environment of austerity, I read these texts as positing the opposite of emotional austerity, a kind of emotional sumptuousness. In these texts, characters and narrators dive, roll, and stuff themselves with their feelings, creating a buffer zone against moral severity. In other words: after Sienne Ngai, I believe that bad feelings often beget secondary bad feelings:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nFor the morally degraded and seemingly unjustifiable status of [ugly] feelings tends to produce an unpleasurable feeling about the feeling (a reflexive response taking the form of \u201cI feel ashamed about feeling envious\u201d or \u201cI feel anxious about my enviousness\u201d\u2026) \r\n</blockquote>\r\n</p>\r\n\t\r\n<p>But the indulgence of these texts allows them to be sparing in their self-reflexivity about feeling. The fidelity with which they move with their moods may, perhaps, account for an austere, minimalist writing style, which does not pass judgment on these shades.</p>\r\n<p>I'm interested in how emotional (not just self-)generosity might be, not an answer, perhaps, but a counterpoint to political calls for economic austerity, and how this might dovetail with the slow mood movement, which is a recent political movement that's trying to reclaim the time to feel our moods out.</p>\r\n<p>In this piece, I do some slow reading. I follow the trail of my associations, leave the text I'm reading behind, and, occasionally, find my way back to it. I rudely bring up new texts and quote from them extensively without much introduction, because sometimes I don't know exactly why they're important. I hope this isn't too frustrating for the reader. I'm asking for time to digress, perhaps partly because hyperlinked schizophrenic interruptions of new content is how the internet has wired my brain to work.</p>\r\n<p>This article comes after Lauren Berlant's paper, \u201cSlow Death (Sovereignty, Obesity, Lateral Agency),\u201d which was the first paper I read that was really curious about the question, \u201cwhat are people doing when they're not acting in a life-building way?\u201d and does such a wonderful job of folding a story about subjectivity into a larger political story, in its adamant disarticulation of the spaces and pleasures of eating fat with the spectacle of the obese person. In a similar way, I'm trying to use the texts in this piece to feel out the spaces (and pleasures?) of moods that are tangential to those that are conducive to the production and reproduction of life under capital, moods that might not comply with our role as docile efficient pleasure-seeking rational self-interested agents, consumers, and workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>III. Away from sadness as crisis: Mary Gaitskill and the \u201cAlso Good\u201d</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words, maybe we don't necessarily need to find a way to stop being anxious or sad. My friend Hannah Manshel's B.A. thesis, \u201cThis is a story about Mary Gaitskill\u2026,\u201d does some good thinking along these lines. She thinks about wavering and rolling in emotion, forms of movement that aren't about finding ways out of a mood but about finding ways in, ways to blend with rather than antagonize a mood.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>It's about having a bad feeling and being able to move into another valence of that feeling to make it feel less bad, allowing for mobility, traveling along the edges and the tangents, wandering into the landscape of [Mary Gaitksill's] <i>Veronica</i> to see what these feelings really do feel like, and to try to find a voice or a genre that's adequate to this amalgamation of literature and theory through feeling.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>In the quotes from <i>Veronica</i> that Hannah returns to in this paper, I find much that's forgiving, that's about making space, accepting, or indulging states of being that others might deem stupid, trivial, or ugly. One example is the concept that she derives of \u201cthe also good:\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Here is Alison's description of her friend Lilet who works with her as a flower vendor in the seedy part of San Francisco: \u201cShe wore thick high heels and she walked proudly, thrusting out not only her breasts, which most girls did, but her stomach and her jaw, too, like they were also good\u201d (33). Alison admires this quality\u2014you could call it shamelessness\u2014in Lilet, who says Alison, \u201clived like music\u201d, which Alison aspires to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is this kind of good? [\u2026] It's a capacious idea of good that incorporates failure and imperfection, for which damages need not be erased. It is, in precisely Gaitskill's terms, an \u201calso good,\u201d a good that makes space for models and sluts and broken girls, that gives them a place to be proud and angry, and even powerful. The also good is a space of possibility that only some people know is worth longing for.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>To de-demonize, de-shame our moments of passivity, weakness, shame, stupidity, to see these moods as movement and to move with them. It's not that the less obviously fetishized parts of the female body, the stomach and the jaw, are \"failure and imperfection,\" but that, like small everyday moments of what might be deemed \"failure and imperfection,\" they are there too (thanks to JR Martin for making this point). It's just that people often don't see fit to strut them. But why not? Why not have sad pride for stretches of nothing? Pathetic Pride? It's worth working towards a world in which one can have slow sad moments and really have them and express them to others without the expression having to take up the status of a humorous aside. Without finding one's self dismissed as merely attention-seeking, histrionic, a whiner, a downer, self-obsessed, childish. But like a queen who finds a way to make gayness funny, perhaps the intermediate stage between this world and that one requires writers who can make dullness interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take, for example, this excerpt from Lydia Davis' <i>The End of the Story:</i></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>I called him, letting the telephone ring fifteen times. I hung up and then drove over to his apartment. His car was there outside the building but his lights were off, and I was sure he was not alone. I went up to his apartment and knocked at the door. He opened it for me in the dark and went back to bed. He lay completely still and did not respond when I got into the bed and tried to talk to him. I got out of the bed. I said I was leaving, and he said nothing, unless it was 'Goodbye' or 'Whatever you like.'</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At home I lay down on my bed and ate a slice of bread and cheese. I got up and brought another slice of bread and cheese. I got up and brought another slice of bread and cheese back to bed, and then another. While I ate, I read a book of poems by a friend, a book that had come recently in the mail, so that while I was filling my mouth with food, I was also filling my eyes with the printed pages and filling my ears with the sound of my friend's voice, and all this filling, all this feeding into different channels, did at last change my condition, whether it really filled something or simply calmed something.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>For the narrator in <i>The End of the Story,</i> feeling translates into drifting. There's something automatic about this description of her movements, something passive about the way she stays in lockstep with the logic of her obsession, as though to describe how she \u201cfeels\u201d at each juncture in this narrative would be redundant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then she eats and reads to pacify herself, which brings to mind the Gaitskill description of a character, Freddie, who \u201chas the face of someone who, after the beating is done, gets up, says 'Okay,' and keeps trying to find something good to eat or drink or roll in.\u201d As Hannah says, \u201cAlison likes Freddie's diving. She likes that he leaps into the murky shit of the canal regardless, that he faces his own submersion literally head-on, that he takes ownership of it but does not try to conquer it.\u201d Just as Freddie faces the beating without passing judgment on the beater, so Gaitskill's description of him describes without diagnosing, brushes up next to him with a metaphor without making him the subject of a claim about psychological origins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To return to the Davis quote, \u201cfilling your channels\u201d and \u201cpacifying\u201d yourself may look like passive avoidance, but what the text demonstrates is that fixation can be the opposite of stuckness. The character in <i>The End of the Story</i> is moving, and it might not be forward, and it might be spreading. But the movement is such that it respects the intentions embedded in her mood, which might be a different kind of intention from her moral, rational intentions. It makes possible the idea of the \u201cmood swing\u201d not (just) as a vertiginous state with no center, nor as an alien force obstructing your competent, productive, form-bearing self, but as something that can be ridden.</p>\r\n<p>It's important what your psychology is. I like riding, rolling, filling, feeding movement metaphors because they can be escapism one moment and confrontation the next, or even both simultaneously\u2014can we say with certainty whether she's \u201cfacing\u201d or \u201cavoiding\u201d her feelings?</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>IV. Rachel Glaser, Breathing, Bits of Wet Paper</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In a lot of celebrated \u201cpoetry of the everyday,\u201d I find very little of my everyday. I guess there's the everyday and then there's the everyday. There's the details and the flux and then there's the way those details feel, an affective mapping of the everyday\u2014the everymood?\u2014which might be really different for different people\u2014that only a few writers have ever done for me. David Foster Wallace was maybe the first, and then I lost the thread for a few years, and picked it up again in the work of Lorrie Moore, Tao Lin, Lydia Davis, Mary Gaitskill, Megan Boyle, and, most recently, Rachel Glaser.\r\nRachel Glaser is a writer who is not especially canonized yet though her genealogy can be traced pretty easily into the current young internet person literary scene. She has written a few stories about sad, anxious, lost girlfriends. They are really good.\r\n\r\nHere are two excerpts to start out with:\r\n\r\n<p>From <i>The Chemical Mist:</i>\r\n<blockquote>There were several boyless months. At first she read The New York Times online until she forgot who she was. Her brain became temporarily up-to-date and genderless. Then she just read the headlines, as if reading a New York Times Online poem. Then she just skimmed the headlines as if conjuring the aura of the day's events.\r\n</blockquote> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>From <i>The Sad Girlfriend:</i>\r\n<blockquote><p>It can seem that nothing is happening. The clouds do their thing over buildings. The commercials cue up at commercial breaks. A story meanders slowly without any discernible plot. But behind these blinds, a world is breathing breaths on top of breaths already breathed. Brad Pitt is slowly falling out of love, and into new love. Matter into energy, energy into light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sad girlfriend paints her nails with polish. She decides to change outfits before the polish has time to dry. It smudges. She does not cry. She wipes the smudged nail on toilet paper and the toilet paper sticks to the smudged nail. So, she uses nail polish remover, which gets her high. Or it doesn't get her high. Or it does get her high. She checks gmail. She checks gmail. She checks gmail.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To paraphrase these last two paragraphs, there's a kind of willing, in these stories, for it to feel like \"something's happening\" even when it seems like it's not. For slowness, distraction and acedia to be also good. \u201cA world is breathing breaths on top of breaths already breathed\u201d makes me think of an Anna Nalick song and also a Dashboard Confessional song, both of which are about how breathing is a basic thing you can do that performs being okay and makes you okay thereby. In these songs, each slow breath is a panic attack avoided. It also reminds me of \u201cBreathe\u201d by Faith Hill, which is about a zero-degree kind of relationality, breathing together as a kind of basic, effortless affirmation of togetherness (although the music video makes me think that maybe it's about masturbation, which also requires breathing).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But breaths on top of breaths are an accumulation of nothings that nevertheless form a history that can be narrated. The accumulation of sentences in these paragraphs flatten differently sized events (reading the New York Times versus reading the headlines versus skimming the headlines), putting into proximity acts that are more 'responsible' with acts that are less, acts that are more 'natural' with acts that are less, acts that are more 'interesting' with acts that are not, and asking that you consider them as part of a continuous life, trying to do the imaginative work of creating a history out of non-events\u2014like checking Gmail. This is life, too.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Glaser's writing then, is writing that at once gains perspective on/stands above/stands \u201csovereign\u201d over the thing it's describing and also refuses to tear it down, deciding that it's also good and making this \u201calso good\u201d apparent. Writing here is the performance of a kind of composure that doesn't crowd out or shame discomposure, like the perfect comeback to a stupid put-down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what is it about sticking toilet paper? It returns later in <i>The Sad Girlfriend,</i> as the main character rides home on the subway late at night.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In 2000 when everything was going to fuck up and then nothing fucked up at all. The whole next millennium lay open, its ten centuries available, its decades in rows. No one is watching us lay toilet paper on the wet public toilet seats. The babies becoming grandmothers.</blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wet toilet paper disintegrates. It is near impossible to get it to be its compliant square flat self after you get it wet. It never absorbs all the water. Bits of it come off in your hands, in the cuts in your face, on your legs. It's not good for much. It leaves a trace where it sits. It lets the wetness through on the toilet seat. It's disposable. Lynda Barry would have you make art with it. This from Hannah's B.A., again:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>In <i>Picture This,</i> a sometimes comic sometimes how-to manual on drawing, Lynda Barry writes \u201cSometimes in life when we are very sad, it is good to make a chicken in winter.\u201d A chicken in winter is an outline of a chicken with cotton balls glued to it. She writes: \u201cplease note: There are times when all we can do is ball up paper and glue it down.\u201d She provides a chicken outline to copy, if you can't seem to make your own. Many pieces of what has become this paper began as my chickens in winter: kinds of writing like wadding up cotton and gluing it down.</blockquote>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn't mean for that to be an ah-ha moment, except insofar as the slow sad performance of mooding is kind of a proud performance. This is what's hard to understand about it\u2014does it really want the world to view moods differently so that it could be otherwise?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent <i>Jacket 2</i> interview, an interviewer asks Tao Lin, essentially, why his book of poetry <i>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</i> is such a sad book, if, according to a lay understanding of cognitive behavioral therapy,\r\n\r\n<blockquote>emotions are brought about by thoughts which are brought about by behaviors and it's this cycle of irrational thoughts that lead to depression. So typically, when we're trying to overcome depression we avoid negative thoughts, but it seems like in [your poetry collection] <i>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,</i> you've done the opposite of that.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<span class = \"dark\">TAO LIN</span>: I think I would prefer in my life to not just block out every negative thought but to learn to have the negative thoughts sort of just like pass through me. I'm not sure how that fits into cognitive behavioral therapy.<br>\r\n</blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fantasy of sad thoughts passing through is like a fantasy of breathing, drifting with one's feelings. Sadness makes questions of scale difficult&mdash;it sometimes feels like sadness must either be a catastrophe or else irrelevant. I think the writers here are trying to imagine a life in which sadness has relevance, before it gets to/without having to see it as having crisis proportions.\r\n\r\n<p>We're in a softer, more drifty space here, but that doesn't mean that <i>everything's</i> the same! Things are still funny/absurd/frightening/sad. Maybe the difference is that each moment is allowed to stay or go for as long as it takes, rather than trying to stay with the sad moments for less time and to stay with the funny moments for a longer time. It's about trying to have your experience be whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The sad girlfriend may die a terrible death of terrorists. There will be no children there to watch with honest eyes. The analyst will be so upset. The sad girlfriend had tried to watch the world news, but the stories lacked the details needed to engage her. Brad Pitt fell for a girl that doesn't wear shoes when she doesn't want to. To have a boyfriend is to play in the privileged center of a story. To be sad is to hang low, matching mind to gravity, to feel the indoors and outdoors so hard it makes your head ring.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This story, like Glaser's other story \u201cPee on Water,\u201d feels like it could keep turning and include a million other people and events\u2014Brad Pitt, the analysts, the clouds. There's an indifference to these facts, but an indifference that's different from the world news which lacks \u201cthe details needed to engage\u201d\u2014every detail in this story is particular and focused. The evenness with which the list turns draws attention to the feeling of being no longer at the center, being decentered, boyfriendlessness. What results is life-as-tangent, being on edge, and the task of the imaginative writer is to make this count as life, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>V. The Slow Mood Movement</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the previous sections I have forborne telling people \u201cwhat to do\u201d about sadness or giving a narrative about how it arises. Instead I have tried to elaborate an atmosphere found in certain writers' works. I like the Slow Mood Movement because it wants to make a movement out of the belief that moods take time and that feeling can be more like eating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I came across the Slow Mood Movement four days ago in <i>Slingshot!</i>, which is a radical newspaper based out of Berkeley. There was an article called \u201cThe Rise of the Brain-Self: How Pharmaceutical Companies Hijacked Our Brains\u201d that developed a narrative about how the modern psychopharmaceutical industry tries to reduce us to the functioning of our brains, which can malfunction and which need the support of their drugs. The article tries to think about what we might be giving up when we give up the means of the production of understanding our moods. Towards the end of the article, it introduced the slow mood movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The slow mood movement takes its cue, obviously, from the slow food movement, all the way to its subtitle: \u201cresisting the buying and selling of fast moods.\u201d Like the slow food movement, which wishes to take food out of the contexts of industry and efficiency, to reclaim eating as a pleasure, a communal activity, and a slow process, so the slow mood movement wishes to reclaim mooding.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The sad girlfriend had tried to watch the world news, but the stories lacked the details needed to engage her.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>I'd like to put these details back into public narratives and political movements, not just in the cheesy news media sense of \u201cpersonal stories\u201d but in the more complicated sense of what's sad, unproductive, and tangential in our emotional experience. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMore Reading:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Slow Mood Movement: <a href = http://slowmoodmovement.wordpress.com>http://slowmoodmovement.wordpress.com</a></li>\r\n<li>Rachel Glaser: <a href = http://rachelbglaser.blogspot.com>http://rachelbglaser.blogspot.com</a></li>\r\n<li><a href = http://rachelbglaser.blogspot.com/2008/09/sad-girlfriend-previously-published-in.html>\"The Sad Girlfriend\" </a></li>\r\n<li><a href = http://route9litmag.com/2011/02/the-chemical-mist/>\"The Chemical Mist\"</a></li>\r\n<li><a href = http://jacket2.org/content/field-tao-lin>Tao Lin Jacket 2 Interview</a></li>\r\n<li><a href = http://supervalentthought.com>Lauren Berlant</a></li>\r\n<li><a href = http://www.penelopeironstone.com/BerlantSlowDeath.pdf>\"Slow Death\"</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nThanks to:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Austin, Michael, Sam and the Hypocrite Reader</li>\r\n<li>Hannah</li>\r\n<li>JR</li>\r\n<li>My mom</li>\r\n</li>Lauren Berlant</li>\r\n<li>Adam, Matthias, Michelle, Jennifer, Laura and the other members of the workshop on poetry and work at The Outer Space Studio</li>\r\n<li>Chicago</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n-->",

But as our author is a redoubtable lady, I think it is not too cruel to bring her to your attention by way of Dorothy Parker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The author in question is Emily Post, grande dame of American manners and author of <i>Etiquette</i> (1922), the definitive volume on how we all ought to behave.  Nowadays Post is remembered mostly as the founder of the Emily Post Institute, which publishes books like the ominously titled <i>\u201cExcuse Me, But I Was Next...\u201d</i> and offers seminars to businesses on \u201ccorporate civility.\u201d  She also makes the rounds as a punch-line to unfunny jokes on TV shows and in movies (\u201cI'm sorry, I guess I skipped the Emily Post chapter about how to introduce your mother to a hooker!\u201d).  Though a few earnest souls continue to take Emily Post seriously, most people do not take her at all, for her preoccupations appear essentially irrelevant to modern life.  Who in the age of the internet needs to read 61 pages of instructions on how to write a letter?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, some would argue that human beings were never in need of a 61-page manual on letter-writing, not even when the mail came twice a day.  Dorothy Parker thought so.  In 1927, she wrote <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1927/12/31/1927_12_31_051_TNY_LIBRY_000033968\">a blistering review</a> of <i>Etiquette</i> for the New Yorker, in which she made clear just how intrusive and absurd she found Post\u2019s rules.   \u201cEmily Post\u2019s <i>Etiquette</i> is out again, this time in a new and an enlarged edition, and so the question of what to do with my evenings has been all fixed up for me,\u201d she begins.  \u201cI am going in for a course of study at the knee of Mrs. Post.  Maybe some time in the misty future, I shall be Asked Out, and I shall be ready.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parker takes her reader through <i>Etiquette</i>\u2019s highlights\u2014its most didactic maxims, its most tedious tropes, its most offensive pretensions.  In a book with \u201call the force and the application of a morality play,\u201d you better believe there is a lot to cover.  Though Parker is pained by the book\u2019s bad prose (\u201cthe author\u2019s invention plucks at the coverlet\u201d), she is more disgusted by its snobbery.  The people that Emily Post puts forth as examples of Best Society appall Parker.  They move through life with \u201cfreezing politeness,\u201d disparaging as \u201cwhite trash\u201d those who are a shade too friendly, too open, or too unpracticed in life\u2019s refinements.  Parker finds such refinement nauseating, animated by a repellent kind of class-awareness.  \u201cI know of no character in the literature of the last quarter century who is such a complete pain in the neck,\u201d she says of one of <i>Etiquette</i>\u2019s exemplars; after one particularly trying chapter, she imagines offering the \u201cold meat-axe\u201d a \u201cgood sock in the nose.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps Parker could forgive a snob\u2014she is a bit snobbish herself, sometimes\u2014but what she cannot forgive is a conformist.  There lies the heart of her argument with <i>Etiquette</i>: that it urges upon us all a kind of stultifying conformity.  Parker, firecracker that she is, wants to talk freely and spiritedly about \u201clife, sex, literature, the drama,\u201d but such exchanges are not possible in Emily Post\u2019s world.  Instead, writes Parker, \u201cthose who are entirely, impeccably right, would seem to arrive at a point of exquisite dullness.\u201d  Conversation, confined to \u201csafe topics,\u201d hovers in an awful limbo.  \u201cYou talk of something you have been doing or thinking about,\u201d instructs Post.  \u201cNot at all a bad plan is to ask advice: \u2018We want to motor through the South. Do you know about the roads?\u2019 Or, \u2018I\u2019m thinking of buying a radio.  Which make do you think is best?\u2019\u201d  Did God create Dorothy Parker to talk like this?  She thinks not.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I may not dispute Mrs. Post.  If she says that is the way you should talk, then, indubitably, that is the way you should talk.  But...there is no force great enough ever to make me say, \u201cI\u2019m thinking of buying a radio.\u201d</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>2, What is wrong with Emily Post?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Etiquette</i> was first published in 1922, when Emily Post was 50 years old.  It was an instant best-seller and has been in print ever since: popular lore says that during World War II, it was the book GI\u2019s requested most frequently as reading material.  (Which report throws my assumptions about military life into some confusion.)  Post handily converted her popularity into an etiquette-themed media empire.  Over the next forty years, she was constantly engaged in revisions of the original book, a spin-off radio show, a daily column, and her eponymous Institute.  By the time of her death in 1960, <i>Etiquette</i> had been revised ten times and was in its 89th printing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet for decades, her readers have echoed Dorothy Parker\u2019s lament.  Does there indeed exist a force\u2014a requirement of good manners or simple sociability\u2014that can compel any of us to participate in a conversation about buying a new radio?  Are such tedious niceties really necessary to social life?  Post\u2019s <i>Etiquette</i> is full of nitpicking rules about the kind of situations that we are accustomed to navigate on our own. We operate by instinct, by private judgment, by past experience, and rarely do we look for an explicit doctrine to guide us.  Why do we need Emily Post to tell us, for example, how to make introductions between strangers?  (\u201cIn introducing a gentleman to a lady, you may ask Mr. Smith if he has met Mrs. Jones, but you must not ask Mrs. Jones if she has met Mr. Smith!\u201d)  How to sign a letter to a friend? (\u201c\u2018Yours in haste\u2019 or \u2018Hastily yours\u2019 is not bad form, but is rather carelessly rude.\u201d) She even tutors us in our cutlery.  (\u201cHave Silver That Shines Or None.\u201d)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Few critics of <i>Etiquette</i> have asked the question, Why might I need these rules?  Instead they tend to ask, What kind of a meat-axe is Emily Post, that she wrote such rules in the first place?  Answers to this question abound.  Modern readers of Post, such as Elizabeth Kolbert (also writing in the New Yorker), have been only too pleased to look for answers in Emily Post\u2019s private life.<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup> The daughter of a prominent architect and a coal heiress, \u201cEmily\u201d was a \u201cgreat beauty,\u201d \u201cslender and tall...with pale skin, dark hair, and a thin nose.\u201d  She moved comfortably but not intimately in New York\u2019s Best Society.  The signal fact of her life, according to this interpretation, was her divorce in 1906 from her husband of thirteen years.  Edwin Post, the rascal, had permitted his affairs with chorus girls and actresses to become fodder for the newspapers.  After demurely standing by her man through the worst of the scandal, \u201cEmily\u201d filed for divorce and lived the rest of her life, Kolbert notes, in contented celibacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critics of <i>Etiquette</i> fashion all sorts of psychological explanations out of this history.  Reviewing a recent biography for the New York Times, one writer discerned in Post \u201ca suffocating, overbearing obsessive.\u201d  Post\u2019s passion for a rule-bound society is traced variously to her status as a perpetual outsider in Best Society; her disgust for her husband, who was hopelessly undisciplined; and the trauma of her very public divorce.  All of these experiences were profoundly destabilizing for Post\u2019s sense of herself, and for her social position.  She longed, allegedly, for a society that was so regimented, so well-ordered, that the scandal of her marriage would have been impossible; and of this kingdom, she wished to be queen.  \u201cThe key,\u201d writes Kolbert, \u201cwas conformity.  This was a lesson that Post herself had clearly internalized...She learned the rules, and she followed them.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Others have taken a less biographical approach to the question, What was wrong with Emily Post?  Wylie Sypher, a writer and scholar who was a contemporary of Dorothy Parker, viewed Emily Post as part of an ill-fated subculture in the early 20th century that aspired to a more traditional, conservative society.  (Sypher elevated Post considerably by comparing her mission with T.S. Eliot\u2019s, but dealt her a bad blow when he called her writing \u201cunrefined.\u201d  Perhaps he was referring to her fervid application of the exclamation point!)  <i>Etiquette</i>, in this analysis, was an attempt to resurrect the norms of a more conservative time by extremely detailed instruction.  Sypher termed this excessive rule-making a \u201ccyborg art,\u201d or the art of turning people into social automatons.  He argued that Post intended to codify social life so completely that all social actors could simply follow her script, \u201centirely automated,\u201d and perform her prescribed rituals with a minimum of engagement.  The perfect gentleman for \u201cMrs. Post,\u201d Sypher claimed, was \u201cl\u2019homme machine.\u201d (\u201cMrs. Post\u201d would have disputed with him on principle: \u201cNever interlard your conversation with foreign words or phrases when you can possibly translate them into English.\u201d)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sypher comes the closest to explaining what so alarms Post\u2019s critics about her vision of etiquette.  Dorothy Parker and her intellectual heirs see etiquette as an instrument by which a great many individuals are taught to do and say and be the same, inane thing.  Spontaneity and creativity have no place in this society.  Individuality has no place, for we are all striving to become reproductions of one another, to repress our own particular interests and desires until we have mastered the performance of a generic Lady or Gentleman.  Our conversations proceed by rote, expressing nothing of our true selves\u2014\u201cI\u2019m thinking of buying a radio, which make do you think best?\u201d  We become interchangeable, and what is worse, exquisitely dull.  Kolbert notes that Post had nothing \u201cpenetrating to say, even in private, on the major issues of her day.\u201d  Who would want to live in such a world, where we are not permitted to think or speak about things that really matter?  Who would think it worth living by these rules, if it means we can never really be ourselves?  Such a world might be comfortable in its own way, but it must eventually become unbearably unreal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3, Emily Post comes to bat</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>And what has Emily Post to say to this?  As I said at the beginning, she was a redoubtable lady, doing battle with Parker and her ilk from the time <i>Etiquette</i> first appeared.  Indeed, given the volume of criticism about Emily Post and <i>Etiquette</i>, surprisingly little of it responds to Post\u2019s own claims.  She was acutely aware of the charges lodged against her, and she argued strenuously against them.  In the 1937 edition of <i>Etiquette</i>, the one I own, she makes her case clearly, passionately, and repeatedly; one cannot help thinking that her critics, in addition to disagreeing with her, have also misunderstood her, or at any rate read her carelessly.  There is certainly a case to make against <i>Etiquette</i>\u2014it is a large and slow-moving target for anyone on the hunt\u2014but it has not been well made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that is not our business here; we have spent enough time with the critics.  Let us sit instead for a moment, as Dorothy Parker never really did, at the knee of Mrs. Post.  What sort of instrument does she imagine etiquette to be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first place, we must dismiss this mistaken notion about etiquette, that it asks us to pretend to be someone we are not.  The critique offered by Parker et al suggests that to be a lady or a gentleman, one must adopt a set of generic gestures, small talk, and other such habits of presentation, which have no basis in our real selves.  This is not any kind of etiquette that Post would recognize.  She has no interest in pretense.  If she has one principle to rule all others, it is the principle of authenticity.  It is almost a crusade with her to make what is \u201creal\u201d the rule of social life: real silver (\u201cin the great dining room, all the silver should be real!\u201d); real flowers (though in wintertime \u201cporcelain ones may take their place\u2014unless there is a lunch or dinner party\u201d); real boots (\u201call leather must be real leather\u201d); real lace (otherwise it is not \u201cthe ideal dress\u201d); real shirt-studs (pearls are the only \u201creal ones\u201d); real names (\u201cnever a nick-name\u201d); even real faces (\u201cpainted faces [never] look like \u2018real\u2019 complexions\u201d). By Post\u2019s lights, an imitation of a grand thing is much worse than offering, cheerfully and unapologetically, what is really ours.<sup><a name=\"id2\" href=\"#ft2\">2</a></sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this rule is true for our belongings, it is doubly true for our selves.  Post insists that well-mannered people be as authentic as their silver.  Indeed, the single most important thing to understand about good manners is that they are never, ever a matter of appearances.  \u201cA gentleman\u2019s manners are an integral part of him and are the same whether in his dressing\u2013room or in a ballroom,\u201d instructs Post.  \u201cHe whose manners are only put on in company is a veneered gentleman, not a real one.\u201d  To master etiquette and meet with social success, one must be actuated by the best \u201cqualities of mind and heart,\u201d not by ambition or obsequy.   The proper denizen of Best Society is not a cyborg but, in Post\u2019s own words, \u201ca real person.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/5/emily_post.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Wesley Clapp</i></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is a \u201creal\u201d person?  What makes for authentic self-presentation?  Drawing on Dorothy Parker\u2019s words, we might think of an authentic person as someone who freely expresses her thoughts and feelings.  If she thinks someone is an old meat-axe, she says so; if she has no interest in making boring small talk, she doesn\u2019t.  Her ideas and her reactions, her desires and her dispositions, are transparent to the society in which she moves.  This is not the kind of authenticity that Emily Post has in mind.  She is less concerned with the transparency of one\u2019s personality than with transparency of character.  Virtues and vices\u2014this is the currency she deals in.  (No wonder Parker was disgusted.)  In \u201cThe True Meaning of Etiquette,\u201d the very first chapter the book, Post defines good manners as \u201cthe code of instinctive decency, ethical integrity, self-respect and loyalty.\u201d  Rules matter only as handmaidens to the genuine expression of real virtue:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Etiquette, if it is to be of more than trifling use, must go far beyond the mere mechanical rules of procedure or the equally automatic precepts of conventional behavior.   Actually etiquette is most deeply concerned with every phase of ethical impulse or judgment and with every choice or expression of taste, since what one is, is of far greater importance than what one appears to be.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThe importance of what one is\u201d&mdash;this is not the province of a cyborg, the concern of the exquisitely dull.  It is the concern of a moralist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Emily Post is, at heart, a moral writer.  Her project is to figure out how the virtues that adhere in us are best expressed in social life.  Decency, integrity, self-respect, loyalty; kindness, courtesy, graciousness, humor.  How do these qualities, if we have really got them, lead us to act in all the messy situations that make up a social experience? What, for example, is the truly gracious way to respond to a guest who is an hour late to dinner?  What is the really loyal thing to say to a friend who is buying an ugly dress?  How can we deal courteously with a boorish companion?  How can we encounter, with integrity, a person we dislike?  How do we show true kindness to someone who is grieving?   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Post, social life is a daily test of character.  Its episodes may be trivial taken one by one, but together they comprise the most significant opportunity we have to be kind, to be decent, to exercise whatever qualities of mind and heart we would like to think we possess.  It is the science of etiquette to make the most of this opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4, \u201cWhat is the purpose of this rule?\u201d </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In a way, Post\u2019s insistence on the authenticity of good manners only makes <i>Etiquette</i> stranger.  For Parker, Kolbert, and Sypher are right about one thing: the book is chock full of rules.  Post may airily dismiss these precepts as \u201ctrifling,\u201d but she wrote almost 900 pages of them all the same.  Why do true kindness and integrity require such instruction?  Are lessons on restaurant etiquette and dating manners really the best way to cultivate these qualities?</p>\r\n<p>To understand the connection between Post\u2019s mission and her many rules, we had better have a further look at the rules themselves. Post\u2019s critics have painted her as obsessive, prescriptive, and arbitrary in her doctrines, but this is not the case.  As for her being obsessive, Post\u2019s detractors do not acknowledge the many kinds of social interactions for which Post gives no guide at all.  <i>Etiquette</i> distinguishes strictly between private and public spheres, and while Post has much to say about our public conduct, she has nothing to say about what we do in private.  How intimate friends should behave towards each other; how brothers and sisters, or parents and children should behave, she remarks not at all.  (In-laws are fair game, and considerable space is devoted to their keeping.)  Marriage itself is beyond her compass.  She says nothing of the relationship between husband and wife, except that it is a \u201cno one\u2019s affair but [their] own.\u201d  To share private details of a marriage is \u201cunspeakable.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>If Post has nothing to say about these private spaces, it is because she thinks we are licensed to talk and act as we please in them.  Life, sex, literature, the drama, the major issues of the day: dig in!  Presumably the only reason that privacy matters, anyway, is that something of real, personal interest is going on in private life. It would not be so wrong for a husband to share his wife\u2019s confidences if his wife had not been saying something pretty interesting to begin with.</p>\r\n<p>Even in public spaces, Post\u2019s approach is more nuanced than she is credited with.  Some social situations she regards essentially as rituals: introductions, for examples, or weddings.   For these scenarios, Post gives explicit rules for what she calls \u201cthe unending details,\u201d so that things will proceed \u201cwith ease and smoothness.\u201d  Here rules maintain the sort of order and peace that everyone is anxious for at \u201cceremonial functions.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>But most of social life is not ceremonial, as Post is well aware.  Going out to dinner or the movies with friends, hosting guests for a weekend, dating: these are parts of social life with which etiquette is intimately concerned, and yet for which it is impossible to make strict rules.  For such fluid situations, Post does not prescribe so much as she exhorts us to use our common sense.  And if we attend to her actual advice, we will find that for the most part it is not only unobjectionable but helpful.  Consider, for example, the suggestion made to \u201ccertain middle-aged men as well as women,\u201d who grumble at the theater or at concerts when new arrivals try to take their seats:</p>\r\n<blockquote>It is quite true that having to gather up opera glasses, program, bag, and stand while each person on a long aisle goes out and comes back separately after every act, can be far from pleasurable.  But if one hasn\u2019t sufficient self-control not only to seem but to be amiable about whatever annoyances one encounters, one should at least take enough trouble to avoid the obvious annoyances or else stay at home.  As an example of the obvious, why not take pains to get seats away from an aisle instead of on it?</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Is this the voice of \u201cfreezing politeness\u201d that set Dorothy Parker a-shuddering?  It is hard to imagine a more benign recommendation than that we should avoid situations that make us snipish.  Indeed, though Post\u2019s advice is sometimes dated, it is never stupid.  To a debutante at her first party, Post says, \u201cOn no account force yourself to laugh.  Nothing is flatter than laughter that is lacking in mirth.\u201d  To someone writing a letter: \u201cBe chary of underscoring and postscripts.\u201d  To one suffering an awkward pause in conversation: \u201cDo not snatch at it.  Let it go for a little while.  Conversation is not a race that must be continued at a break-neck pace lest the prize be lost.\u201d  To an unhappy guest: \u201cNo matter how much the hours or food or arrangements may upset you, you must appear blissfully content.\u201d  (In the next section, she takes pity and advises him to escape the party: \u201cYou May Send Yourself A Telegram.\u201d)   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may object to some of these rules.  Indeed, the modern reader will probably find the passages on courtship amusing (\u201cHow far may a girl run after a man? Cat-like, she may do a little stalking!\u201d).  This is only to say that Emily Post lived in the early 20th century, and we live in the early 21st century.  But even where we disagree with Post, her basic thoughtfulness is undeniable.  Her stipulation that \u201cif the cake is very soft and sticky or filled with cream, small forks must be laid on the tea table\u201d is rather touching.  Even that old rule about introductions, by which we are forbidden to ask Mrs. Jones if she has met Mr. Smith before, sets me thinking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this is precisely the point of <i>Etiquette</i>\u2014to set us thinking, all the time, about the meaning of the things we do and say. Good manners for Emily Post are never mindless.  They are never simple acts of obedience.  She despises any understanding of etiquette that treats social life like \u201ca sum in arithmetic.\u201d  Etiquette, she makes clear, is the product of a constant, critical engagement with our social surroundings.  No precepts, even Post\u2019s own, should escape our scrutiny.  \u201cWhat is the purpose of this rule?\u201d she prods us. \u201cDoes it help to make life pleasanter?  Does it make the social machinery run more smoothly?  Does it add to beauty?  Is it essential to the code of good taste or to ethics?\u201d  Dorothy Parker read <i>Etiquette</i> as a \u201cmorality play,\u201d but it lacks a glib ending.  Emily Post ultimately commends us to our own judgment.  \u201cThe best rule is your innate good sense\u2014and sensibility.\u201d</p>\r\n \r\n\r\n<h3>5, An argument for rules</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>But good sense, unfortunately, is not always innate.  Sometimes we meet with situations that surpass our sensibility, or that stump our judgment.  Social life is so very complicated.  It is complex, with feedback loops and chains of effect that we cannot possibly intuit, and opaque, full of people about whom we know almost or actually nothing.  Naming virtues for social life is simple enough (Post herself tosses off definitions with an easy athleticism), but in this dark, confusing world, it is sometimes hard to see how we translate these impulses into real action.  Where does loyalty cross into adulation, or into prejudice?  When does humor amuse, and when does it insult?  What is the line between kindness and condescension?  Sometimes we know the answers to these questions, but in many encounters we honestly do not.  Good intentions so easily miss their targets.  This is the strange truth at the heart of <i>Etiquette</i>: that even as we strive to engage in social life as authentically as we can, with all our qualities of mind and heart, such engagement never comes naturally.  Being \u201ca real person\u201d is not at all intuitive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet our impulses count for nothing if we do not know how to express them fluently.  Loyalty does not consist in loyal intentions, but in loyal actions.  Likewise the desire to be funny is worthless if we do not actually know how to make people laugh. What are we to do, then, when we don\u2019t know what to do? How can we bridge impulse and action, to give our baffled yearnings for loyalty and humor, courtesy and integrity, some outward reality?  Post\u2019s answer is simple, but marvelous: \u201cPractice.\u201d  The expression of courtesy can be learned, and an impulse for integrity can be trained.  \u201cA few rare persons are born with quick perception and innate kindness,\u201d she says (in a chapter she gloriously titles, \u201cWhat We Contribute to the Beauty of Living\u201d), \u201cbut in greatest measure tact, like most of the social graces, is the result of training.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rules and precepts offer such training, by channeling our inept intentions into concrete actions. Some rules make us more sensitive to the implications of behavior we would otherwise overlook, as with Post\u2019s counsel against signing a letter \u201cYours in haste.\u201d  In the same way, she advises against introducing one person to another as \u201cmy friend,\u201d for it \u201cimplies that the other person is not.\u201d  These sorts of transgressions are minor, but they are Emily Post\u2019s bread and butter.  A lifetime\u2019s worth of insulting introductions will leave some stain on a man\u2019s soul.  At other times, the rules of etiquette help us make sense of situations that utterly stymie us, when we feel helpless to find expression for our good impulses.  In a section about writing letters of condolence, Post gives beautiful, lucid rules for one such impossible task:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Don\u2019t dwell on the details of illness or the manner of death; don\u2019t quote endlessly from the poets and the Scriptures.  Remember that eyes filmed with tears and an aching heart cannot follow rhetorical lengths of writing.  The more nearly a note can express a hand-clasp, a thought of sympathy, above all, a genuine love or appreciation of the one who has gone, the greater comfort it brings.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>We are accustomed to think of rules as that which confine us, or bind us, or prevent somehow the free movement of our thoughts and actions.  But for Emily Post, the opposite is true.  She considers that we are already pretty badly handicapped when it comes to social life, both by the obscurity of other people and by the complexity of our relations with them.  We cannot live freely and easily as ourselves\u2014kind, courteous, what-have-you\u2014because we don\u2019t know what kindness really looks like among these strangers, or what our courtesy should do.  We are confined in an awful state of suspense: does this mean to other people what it means to me?  Did she interpret that gesture correctly?  Did he take my comment the wrong way?  Was that an insult?  Was that supposed to be a joke?  Between two strangers at a dinner party, these questions will cause some frostiness; between a woman and her mother-in-law, they will cause something much worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Emily Post, the rules of etiquette offer relief from our natural limitations.  By putting order on our interactions with the world and providing stable pathways from intention to action, etiquette frees us to interact meaningfully and genuinely with other people.  When Dorothy Parker thought of making small talk about radios, she was oppressed by the prospect of insincerity and intolerable boredom.  But for Emily Post, the same prompt offers something much more hopeful: the gentle beginnings of a conversation, by which we might bring ourselves out into the great, messy unknown of a social life: \u201cI\u2019m thinking of buying a radio...\u201d <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\">\r\n<p><sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nThis piece, like most recent articles on Emily Post, was occasioned by Laura Claridge\u2019s 2008 biography, <i>Emily Post: Daughter of the Gilded Age, Mistress of American Manners.</i></p>\r\n<p><sup><a name=\"ft2\" href=\"#id2\">2</a></sup>\r\nSilver, pearls, flowers in the wintertime\u2014is etiquette for the wealthy alone? The answer is a complicated \u201cno.\u201d While Emily Post was undoubtedly a snob, and while much of <i>Etiquette</i> (particularly earlier editions) assumes a wealthy audience, the book advocates norms of gentility that transcend class.  For Post, good manners create a meeting ground for people from different backgrounds. Class issues are complexly woven through the book, however, and worth exploring in their own right.</p>\r\n</div>",

Memory, in the structure of Olympian Greek myth, is in the realm of deed, not thought. It acts upon you. He says so all but explicitly in the penultimate paragraph of the essay: \u201cIn a certain sense, the trial also represents a victory of thought over memory. \u2026  We can ask what he ought to have done. Thought gains primacy over the deed....\u201d This paragraph itself presents a fascinating dichotomy. On the ascendant: thought, along with speech and reason, as well as argument, motive, and justice. In decline: deed and memory, along with the weight of guilt. Forgetting falls into the former camp, serving as an antidote to memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Memory here serves a mechanistic function. It is \u201cthe way the past presses on us,\u201d not via our own mental work but via an external mechanism. Memory waits patiently outside of us; it takes the faceless forms of the Fates and the Furies. This is why Tantalus acts without reason: because the whole of his person is present to memory in his actions alone. That is, the human subject is affected by memory in the realm of activity and not in the realm of conscious consideration. Whereas the gods possess insight\u2014which is a defense against the traps laid by their enemies\u2014human beings are driven completely by impulse, of which memory is a kind. It works as a force: thus too the weight of guilt. The weight of guilt is fundamentally different from justice. It is generated unthinkingly by the circumstance of one\u2019s actions. Justice considers one\u2019s actions but is primarily a reconfiguration of them by way of speech, reason, and argument. Speech, reason, argument and therefore justice are all symptoms of our interpretive ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Memory, as we conceive of it presently, has migrated to the genre of the above modes of interpretation. Memory for us is as much a process of filtering as of retention. Forgetting is integral to this kind of memory. A curse, however, is external to us, is never inconsistent, it never disappears when we ignore it. It is complete unto itself and it is insistent. Such memory has its own ledger\u2014it won\u2019t allow you to forget upon it. It is free from you.</p>\r\n",

We can obviously have <i>appreciation</i> for the technical elements of film\u2014editing, sound, cinematography, etc.\u2014but when it comes down to it, a film is a unity of elements, a world that is constituted by the assembly of these elements under a hegemonic principle. Sometimes this hegemony is exercised by a production company or franchise, rather than by a single director (for example, the Judd Apatow comedy franchise of the mid-2000s). However, what most appeals to film spectators about auteurism is not that it gives us access to the subjectivity of the individual director, but rather that the works of an auteur form a series, system, or \u201cworld\u201d that is somehow continuous, and that by watching the complete works of an auteur (even an auteur-producer such as Apatow), we achieve the fullest possible representation of this world. We have, for example, the New York of Martin Scorsese and the New York of Woody Allen, and to the extent that these auteurs are indeed auteurs, they present different, mutually exclusive images of the city. It does no good to imagine Travis Bickle and Alvy Singer somehow crossing paths in the \u201creal New York,\u201d because such an encounter would be \u201cstaged\u201d according to the sensibility of whoever was imagining it, and would transpire according to a \u201cworldview\u201d foreign to that of either director. Films therefore place us in a world that is not our own\u2014a world that absorbs us while we are immersed in it and haunts us long after we have emerged.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd what more can we ask of this medium?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs it turns out, a lot more. And this \u201ca lot more\u201d is the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier, a genius both maligned and misread, and whose work represents one of the few truly revolutionary contributions to cinema in the past twenty years. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI have not seen <i>Melancholia</i> (released at Cannes this May) nor is it likely that I will see it until November, when it opens in the U.S. (If culture can travel this slowly in the information age, it is perhaps a happy sign that culture has not yet been reduced to information.) So if there is an occasion for this piece, it is not the film itself, but rather the scandal surrounding von Trier, who was banned from Cannes after a string of supposedly anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi comments he made at the film\u2019s press conference.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVon Trier is known more for his provocations than for the quality of his work\u2014for the tattoo of the letters F-U-C-K on his knuckles, for scenes of genital mutilation in 2010\u2019s <i>Antichrist</i>, for his declarations that Barack Obama has a white man inside of him, and that George W. Bush wanted to be whipped by Condoleezza Rice, etc., etc., etc. And of course the shallowness and sensationalism of this media image is characteristic if not constitutive of the contemporary figure of the celebrity, leading many to claim that his provocations and transgressions (both within his movies and in his capacity as a public figure) are empty bids for recognition rather than legitimate artistic statements.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt should not be taken as an a priori defense of von Trier that many canonical films have a dubious political or sexual content that is at once \u201cdeep\u201d and meretricious (most notably the films of Alfred Hitchcock, which indulge the viewer\u2019s voyeurism to a greater extent than they subvert it). If we are to take the medium seriously, which I do, we ought to believe that it has real effects on the viewer beyond mere diversion, and that an indulgence in certain movies (no matter how artful or intelligent) can be both a symptom and an enabling cause of various forms of ethical and political dishonesty. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn this case, I believe it\u2019s necessary to examine the various misinterpretations and reaction-formations that are built into the meaning of a work of art. Even if we can discern some deeper moral or political content in a given film, this content may not be present to most viewers, who may even take away from a film the very ideology that it is meant to critique (the obvious proof of this is the use of various anti-war films as training and propaganda for American soldiers). Since von Trier\u2019s movies often feature the mistreatment of women, should we therefore conclude that whatever their deeper message, they function if not as instigators of violence, at the very least as pornographic wish-fulfillment of various misogynist male fantasies?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe cannot acquit von Trier of these changes simply by arguing that his films are not only violent but ALSO sensitive, not only offensive but ALSO artistic. This \u201cALSO\u201d implies a trade-off, an acknowledgment that von Trier might as well make films that are less offensive, and that their offensiveness is accidental rather than essential to their merit. In this case, his critics are indeed justified in labeling his work as meretricious, pornographic, etc.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd indeed in the manifesto written for his third feature film, <i>Europa</i>, von Trier acknowledges and affirms a sexual impulse present in his work:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t[...] Our relationship to film can be described in so many ways, and is explained in myriad different ways: We have to make films with a pedagogical purpose, we can desire to use film as a ship that can carry us off on a voyage of discovery to unknown lands, or we can claim that we want to use film to influence our audience and get it to laugh or cry\u2014and pay. All this can sound perfectly OK, but I don't think much of it.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tThere is only ONE excuse for suffering and making other people suffer the hell that the genesis of a film involves: the gratification of the fleshly desires that arise in a fraction of a second, when the cinema's loudspeakers and projector, in tandem, and inexplicably, allow the illusion of movement and light to find their way like an electron leaving its path and thereby generating the light needed to create ONE SINGLE THING: a miraculous blast of LIFE! THIS is the only reward a film-maker gets, the only thing he hopes and longs for. This physical experience when the magic of film takes place and works its way through the body, to a trembling ejaculation [...] NOTHING ELSE! There, now it's written down, which feels good. So forget all the excuses: 'childish fascination' and 'all-encompassing humility', because this is my confession, in black and white: LARS VON TRIER, THE TRUE ONANIST OF THE SILVER SCREEN.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tAnd yet, in <i>Europa</i>, the third part of the trilogy, there isn't the least trace of derivative manoeuvering. At last, purity and clarity are achieved! Here there is nothing to hide reality under a suffocating layer of 'art' [...] no trick is too mean, no technique too tawdry, no effort too tasteless.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\tJUST GIVE ME ONE SINGLE TEAR OR ONE SINGLE DROP OF SWEAT AND I WOULD WILLINGLY EXCHANGE IT FOR ALL THE 'ART' IN THE WORLD.\r\n\t</p> \r\n\t<p>\r\n\tAt last. May God alone judge me for my alchemical attempts to create life from celluloid. But one thing is certain: life outside the cinema can never find its equal, because it is His creation, and therefore divine.\r\n\t</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIs this \u201conanism\u201d common to all film-making? And if so, is Trier simply confirming the view of Fredric Jameson (among others) that \u201cpornographic films are thus only the potentiation of films in general, which ask us to stare at the world as though it were a naked body\u201d?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn fact, it is supremely misguided to identify the onanism described here with the \u201crapt, mindless fascination\u201d characteristic of both pornography and movie-watching in general. In fact, the onanism we associate with pornography is pornography\u2019s negation, bringing to an end the viewer\u2019s \u201crapt, mindless fascination\u201d and returning him to an uglier and disenchanted, but also more visceral, reality. Therefore, insofar as von Trier\u2019s movies are onanistic in this sense, they are fighting a quixotic battle against the hypnotic, pornographic function that lies at cinema\u2019s very essence.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd in fact, <i>Europa</i> begins with the provocation that by watching it we are willingly giving ourselves up to hypnosis. We see advancing train tracks surrounded by darkness and over this image we hear the voice of the narrator instructing us to close our eyes and descend into \u201cEuropa.\u201d Into what are we descending\u2014the continent? The film itself? One thing is certain\u2014we are being told to suspend our autonomy and submit to the film\u2014just as we surrender to every film we watch. And the presumably innocent passivity of the viewer is mirrored within the film itself by the innocent passivity of the protagonist, Leopold Kessler, a pacifist American who acquires a position as a sleeping car conductor in post-World War Two Germany, assuming (falsely, as it turns out) that he will not be tainted by the country\u2019s disastrous political history. Kessler gradually discovers the existence of an underground Nazi resistance network whose agents attempt to make him an accessory to their terrorist plots against the new regime. The hypnotic movement of the train is as inexorable as the passage of history, while the menial labor that Kessler performs in the sleeping car plays out the stupid material exigencies that bind subjects to their social roles and prevent them from reflexively realizing their complicity in the disasters of history.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVon Trier\u2019s interest in the ideology and habitus of wage labor can be compared with that of Jean-Luc Godard, who, in films such as <i>Tout Va Bien</i> and <i>Passion</i>, attempted to remedy the exclusion of labor and the workplace from cinema by portraying the tactical deliberations taking place among militant factory workers. If von Trier\u2019s treatment of this material is more successful (particularly in <i>Europa</i>, <i>Dancer in the Dark</i> and <i>Dogville</i>), it is because unlike Godard, who focuses on the opinions and ideas of workers who already have some reflexive consciousness of their class or individual interests, von Trier isolates the process of labor itself in its most atomized and alienated form. In this form, labor appears as a dream or a trance, and our inability to awake from the nightmare of history is identified with the hypnotic effects of both capitalist production and postmodern cultural consumption.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn a desperate attempt to end this nightmarish trance, Kessler ends up colluding with the terrorists and detonating the bomb they have entrusted him with. However, instead of freeing him from history, this act of terrorism throws him back into it, and both the corpse and the viewer are consigned by the narrator to an eternal zombie-like hypnosis from which even death offers no escape:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nIn the morning, the sleeper has found rest on the bottom of the river. The force of the stream has opened the door and is leading you on. Above your body, people are still alive. Follow the river as days go by. Head for the ocean that mirrors the sky. You want to wake up to free yourself of the image of Europa. But it is not possible.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe film ends and we want to wake up. But the dream-state of the film is of a piece with the dream-like passivity of our own historical immersion, and even after we are dead, our participation in history will persist like a stain upon the world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn light of this analysis, von Trier\u2019s statements on Nazism become much more intelligible. If Trier calls himself a Nazi, it is because he believes that the sins of history do not disappear with those who commit them, but continue to animate the politics of the present moment. The acknowledgment of this complicity is symbolized in <i>Europa</i> by the taking of the Eucharist, a sacrament identical in function to von Trier\u2019s heretical doctrine of cinematic onanism\u2014the transformation of immaterial (and therefore spiritual) light into living flesh.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\nTo what extent should von Trier\u2019s historical narratives be read as expressions of political defeatism? After all, many of von Trier\u2019s later films\u2014notably, <i>Dogville</i>, <i>Manderlay</i>, <i>The Boss of it All</i>, and <i>Antichrist</i>\u2014detail the inability of their idealistic protagonists to escape or transcend preexisting models of oppression, from racism to capitalism to misogyny. Do all of the political sentiments aroused in these films amount to no more than spilt seed?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn fact, this skepticism with regard to the value of representation is thematized throughout von Trier\u2019s work. <i>Dogville</i>, in particular, interrogates the value of allegory through the male protagonist\u2019s obsession with \u201cillustration.\u201d When Grace (Nicole Kidman), a mysterious woman with a dangerous past, seeks refuge in Dogville, the young idealist Tom Edison (Paul Bettany) takes it as an opportunity to teach the denizens of the Depression-era Colorado town the virtues of acceptance and inclusion, which he thinks are badly lacking. For Tom, whose sermons on moral rearmament have heretofore made little impression on the townspeople, Grace\u2019s presence is welcome insofar as her outsider status is a concrete illustration of the very moral problems he seeks to address. Throughout the film, the narrator continues to draw our attention first and foremost to Tom\u2019s problem of illustration, even as the community becomes increasingly exploitative of Grace and ultimately turns her into a slave. Insofar as the townspeople treat Grace badly, has this illustration been a success or a failure? And what about the film itself, whose allegorical status is spelled out from the beginning by the fact that it takes place on an empty set, with only the most necessary props, and lines drawn on the ground to indicate the location of houses? Does <i>Dogville</i> illustrate the need for moral rearmament? Does it illustrate the vanity of political projects? Does it illustrate something about illustration itself? Or does its critique of illustration block our reading of it as an illustration of anything, indicating that its significance derives not from its content but from its perlocutionary effects?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn <i>Dogville</i> \u201cillustration\u201d has two meanings. On the one hand, illustration is the imitation of reality in a work of art (for example, the moralizing novel that Tom wants to write). And on the other hand, illustration is reality itself insofar as reality is an illustration of deeper laws and truths. And it is in this second sense that Grace\u2019s presence in Dogville is, for Tom, an illustration\u2014the incarnation of the abstract principles that Tom wants to impart to the community. <i>Dogville</i> itself (and indeed any representational work of art) is certainly an illustration in this first sense. But what about the second sense? Is the film <i>Dogville</i> really a fleshly incarnation of a more immaterial truth or reality?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPerhaps the answer to this question (and to the question of the success or failure of <i>Dogville</i> as a political allegory, i.e. as a \u201crealistic\u201d illustration of deeper truths) depends partly on what the film is an allegory of, partly on whether this deeper level of meaning is \u201ctrue,\u201d and partly on whether the artifice of the film succeeds in making contact with and confirming this deeper meaning. Fredric Jameson, following Althusser\u2019s discussions of \u201cideology,\u201d has frequently commented on the provisionality of such interpretive schemes, describing the allegorical function of art as \u201ccognitive mapping.\u201d \u201cCognitive mapping\u201d is an attempt to grasp reality not by revealing a deeper metaphysical meaning, but by locating the dominant structures that determine the social world as a totality. While a description of the dominant structure alone does not exhaust the possible explanations for and interpretations of reality (in Althusser\u2019s terminology, reality is \u201coverdetermined\u201d), its virtue for Jameson is that it provides a useful retooling of the concept of \u201cclass consciousness\u201d\u2014imagined not as an incoherent mass of <i>ressentiment</i> and populist fantasies, but rather as a strategic conceptualization of the historical conjuncture.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe concept of cognitive mapping can certainly be applied to <i>Dogville</i>, particularly since we see the town appear to us not as itself, but as its map, its plan, its structure, the chalk marks on the stage that take the place of a set. The transparency of the houses makes visible the town\u2019s social dynamic, and in one sequence, the town\u2019s temporality too becomes visible, as we see Grace move through her ever more grueling series of daily chores, the spatial progress of her work tracing like the hands of a clock the passing hours of the day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYet despite <i>Dogville</i>\u2019s explicitly allegorical style, what the film is an allegory of is actually difficult to pin down. For example, we can treat the town of Dogville equally plausibly as America itself or as some Third-World victim of American \u201chumanitarian\u201d intervention. On the one hand, the exploitation of Grace is structurally identical to the exploitation of illegal immigrants who are cited as a threat to \u201chomeland security,\u201d but are also a necessary part of the American economy, and whose successful exploitation by this economy depends in large part on their illegal status. From her subjective position, however, Grace is more like a liberal multiculturalist who romanticizes the innocence of \u201ctraditional\u201d small-scale societies in spite of their own reactionary and oppressive social structures. The gangsters, like America itself, are no less innocent, and as much as we are led to despise the people of Dogville, the massacre at the end of the film translates into a disturbing allegory for the senseless violence of American imperialism.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf <i>Dogville</i> contains so many political registers, how do we order these registers into a hierarchy of meaning? How indeed can any of von Trier\u2019s works be treated as political films if their allegorical content  is so ambiguous that the best we can do is read them as vague \u201ccommentaries\u201d on this or that political abstraction\u2014for example, the instrumentalization of politics and the incompatibility of such instrumentalization with democracy (my capsule summary of <i>Manderlay</i>). These readings multiply endlessly and are a testament to the complexity and intelligence of von Trier\u2019s work. However, such readings are to my mind contrary to the spirit of these films, which set as their standard of value not the multiplicity of possible interpretations, but the immediate intellectual and emotional experience they generate. This is what we might call the \u201creality\u201d of the film\u2014the concrete aesthetic experience that is an illustration or incarnation of more general truths\u2014a film\u2019s effects rather than its latent content.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo ask what this \u201creality\u201d consists in is to ask after a film\u2019s genre, in other words, the relationship a film bears towards other culture products, a relationship necessarily mediating its reception by an audience. I would argue that in von Trier\u2019s movies, as in so many other \u201cpostmodern\u201d films, the ultimate \u201cmeaning\u201d often derives as much from their musical soundtrack as from their narrative logic. It would be wrong to believe that von Trier\u2019s music merely disposes the viewer to a certain mood like a pair of colored glasses (as in the majority of Hollywood productions), or adds a layer of emotional reinforcement to what would otherwise be a moment of bewildering visual ambiguity (as in the films of Terrence Malick). Rather, pop music (or baroque music, von Trier\u2019s other soundtrack of choice) is always used to achieve a specific supplementary effect, above and beyond generating a merely complementary atmosphere.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat is simultaneously uncomfortable and powerful about von Trier\u2019s use of pop music is that it reveals the secret affinity between suffering and media culture, not by showing suffering or sadism as the privileged content or logical extension of media culture (a theme addressed with regard to visual culture in movies such as <i>Vertigo</i> or <i>Peeping Tom</i>), but rather by juxtaposing subjective pop-culture fantasies with the harsh material conditions which these fantasies attempt to transform. Thus, the seventies pop soundtrack of <i>Breaking the Waves</i> (paired with kitsch images of twilight landscapes and seascapes) presents to us Bess\u2019s private reimagining of her oppressive surroundings, while Selma\u2019s interior musical fantasies in <i>Dancer in the Dark</i> show us how she is able to find pleasure in her grueling factory job. In the credits of <i>Dogville</i> and <i>Manderlay</i>, similarly, the juxtaposition of David Bowie\u2019s \u201cYoung Americans\u201d with iconic images of American poverty, violence, and the civil rights movement shows the struggle between fantasy and reality.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCulture (and especially pop music) is commonly treated as escapism, as fantasy, and as religion, and is therefore considered irrelevant to the inherent ugliness of wage labor under capitalism. What von Trier\u2019s pop films reveal is what Slavoj \u017di\u017eek refers to as the efficacy of illusion, or the inscription of illusion effects within reality. To simply dismiss these illusions or attempt to supplant them with some progressive or \u201cpopulist\u201d political culture is to miss the point, which is that these illusions are as much the product of a desire for the Good as they are a product of consumerist decadence and self-deception (in other words, they contain what Fredric Jameson calls the \u201cutopian impulse\u201d).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPop, as we see in <i>Dancer in the Dark</i>, is not autonomous from processes of labor and production. Like the work song, which must be as old as music itself, popular music incorporates within its form the repetitive rhythms of labor, even if this connection is typically disavowed in favor of its more comfortable affiliation with autonomous art and the mass media. In <i>Dancer</i>, von Trier brings together the clich\u00e9 mass media elements of popular music with its inherent potential for creative reinterpretation and individual expression.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nReturning to the case of <i>Dogville</i>, the use of David Bowie\u2019s \u201cYoung Americans\u201d over the end credits radically alters the film, which up to that point has an exclusively baroque soundtrack (von Trier uses the exact same schema in <i>Dogville</i>\u2019s sequel, <i>Manderlay</i>). After the gangsters have massacred the townspeople, we see from above the chalk drawing of the dog on the empty stage\u2014the same dog that barked at Grace at her first entrance into Dogville. Suddenly, the chalk dog stands up\u2014it has in an instant become a real dog--and barks menacingly. As the credits roll we hear David Bowie\u2019s \u201cYoung Americans\u201d juxtaposed against iconic photographs of the Great Depression and other scenes of American poverty and violence. Both of these operations show something that has been repressed from the film itself. Obviously von Trier could have made a movie that all along had a real dog, as well as real houses and real mountains and real sunlight. Similarly, he could have made a documentary featuring real historical footage from the great depression. Nevertheless, this \u201creality\u201d only emerges at the end as a way of pointing to the insufficiency of film itself insofar as its reality effects rely on stereotyped forms of verisimilitude. Even these final documentary images figure as iconic Americana rather than as a reality to be confronted. And so between the disturbing allegory played out on the empty stage and the disturbing photographs we know to be true but that nevertheless appear frozen and canonical, the image of the greatest power is that the of the dog\u2014the transition from the symbol to the thing itself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd what is this thing itself if not the suffering that von Trier depicts on screen? Von Trier\u2019s films, like all great films, generate powerful images that incorporate themselves into the subconscious mind, and deploy fantasies that generate strong emotional identifications. However, von Trier\u2019s films are always an affirmation of reality over cinema. No matter how much we buy into the aesthetic fantasies he depicts, these fantasies are always framed as partially successful ways of dealing with reality, never replacements of it. The questions von Trier raises cannot be posed to the films themselves but only to the reality into which they cast us out.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Melancholia</i>, von Trier\u2019s latest film, deals with the end of the world. This theme is a reminder of a strangely ignored feature of representation\u2014that all representation points back to this one world, reality and history to which there is no alternative. The multiplicity of representations gives us the false impression that there are a multiplicity of realities that can coexist side by side without conflict\u2014a reality of art and a reality of politics, a reality of subjectivity and a reality of objectivity. A reality of the present and of history, of consumption and of production, escapism and suffering, representation and the Real. To say that there is a single reality is not to conflate or reduce these oppositions, but to recognize reality as a site of suffering and conflict that such partial views occlude by pretending to autonomous purity. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n</p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nWe are a nation obsessed with entrances. Even though formality has faded from many aspects of our culture, we continue to repeat the ritual of ceremonial arrival. Football games begin with the traditional players\u2019 charge into the stadium. Awards ceremonies would be nothing without lengthy red carpets. The president has an exclusive entrance song. Clearly we can\u2019t get enough of people arriving at things. The obsession holds true in private life as well, in romantic notions such as the slow-motion descent down a staircase before the watchful eyes of our waiting date. And why not? The entrance is indeed the glorious announcement of our hopes for the event. In a proud walk, a simple smile, or a heroic charge, the participants set a tone for the evening and assert their inclusion in the affair. The entrance is a way to be seen and be counted. It is a moment of a sort of innocence, when dresses are unruffled by shifting in seats and brows are free of sweat. The entrance should be watched and celebrated. But what about the exit?     \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe see all the celebrities walking into the Kodak Theater, but not one of them coming out. Why aren\u2019t the attendees required to provide an exit equaling the stature and entertainment of their entrance? If Lady Gaga goes into the Grammys in an egg, why doesn\u2019t she leave as a chicken? Why do we have \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d but no \u201cBye, Chiefy, See You Later?\u201d By performing only the entrance and not the exit, we are missing out on literally half of our opportunities for pomp and glamour. In these forgotten farewell moments lie chances for fame and legend, for indeed what the audience remembers last, they remember longest. With just a little effort, we can grasp the glory of the curtain call, the thrilling getaway, and the last laugh. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<img src=\"/media/images/6/gagachicken.jpg\" class=\"picture\">\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Illustration by Naomi Bardoff</i>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPresumably we don\u2019t watch awards show exits because they turn out to be as boring as our own party exits: disheveled or drunk versions of the attendees ducking into cars and going home. As a party ends, we may worry about wrinkled clothes, tired posture, or overindulgence in alcohol, and so we slink away in defeat. Instead of fearing our post-event appearance, however, we should embrace it, showing off that torn dress, smudged make-up, and inability to form a coherent sentence. In a loud and stumbling exit through the crowd, you could in fact gain the venerated title of the one who partied the hardest. In fact, any reputation you\u2019re trying to develop can be supported by a proper exit. If you\u2019re trying to build a reputation as the adventurous type, try exiting your next party with stunt. You could follow the likes of John Wilkes Booth and leap from a balcony. A broken limb obtained in the course of leaving is something people will talk about for years to come. If you\u2019d like to be the villainous type, the exit is an essential time for declaring your vow to get revenge. Simply shout out your feelings, such as \u201cyou\u2019ll pay for the lack of Cool Ranch Doritos!\u201d, as you back out the door. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen decisively executed and properly timed, the exit can be your chance to shape the event itself. Consider the business meeting exit technique of \u201cSeinfeld\u201d character George Costanza. George rarely has anything intelligent or funny to say, but the one time he has a hit joke, he stands up and says farewell with due haste. His general incompetence and lack of participation no longer matter because he has a charming and memorable exiting line. If only this technique were applied to foreign policy, maybe we wouldn\u2019t be in so many damned wars. We could just wait for one really good battle and then regally wave goodbye.           \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHave you ever broken up with someone only to find that they still call you and try to follow you around? If your exit from the break-up moment is decisive and memorable, perhaps you won\u2019t have to resort to screening your calls. Instead of that slow, sad walk away after the terminating conversation, try a gait that further emphasizes your reasons for leaving. If you\u2019re ditching the romance because of cheating, lying, or other bad behavior, march away with righteousness, pumping your fist to punctuate your moral high ground. If you\u2019re leaving because things were getting too serious, a nice skipping motion would not only show that you\u2019re sure about your decision but also help your former partner realize that you\u2019re clearly not a stable person and they should just steer clear. If you want to see other people because your love interest\u2019s recent fascination with trepanation has started to creep you out, then simply run, run as fast as you can.     \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen we clearly mark the beginning of some event but negate the finish, we stagnate. The part of us that craves pageantry and ritual waits anxiously for the red carpet exit and isn\u2019t satisfied with just going to bed after the credits roll. If we don\u2019t create an ending, our life becomes a series of linked beginnings, bravado that never reaches culmination. The performance of exiting shows that we are moving on to something. We must boldly grasp these chances for self expression and no longer leave the audience hanging, no longer go gentle into that good night. Though we may not know where the next beginning lies, knowing that we\u2019ve made an exit is at least a start.   \r\n<img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

On my morning commute, I prepare perfect one-liners in the off chance that my downtown express train hops the track and takes out everyone on board. <i>I knew I should\u2019ve taken the local,</i> or something to that effect.

Glaring into my reversed reality just long enough to break natural focus, the minimal distance created between persistence and perception provided fertile battleground in which to cultivate imagined orders for the hereafter. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Not yet,</i> I commanded it with little more than a glare. <i>I\u2019m next on the beer pong table.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDespite countless iterations, I am only just now starting to understand the inner workings of my macabre musings. I struggle to understand why I spend so many hours romanticizing what I would want to hear myself say as the curtain falls. Taking into account the full corpus of my gloomy reflections, one central theme pushes back the shadows and highlights what I think I\u2019m really looking for when staring into the abyss: <i>control.</i> Some of us know when the next breath will be our last, but those enlightened few are in the great minority. Ideally I would still want to feel like it was I captaining the ship right up until the end. And at the very least, I wouldn\u2019t want to sound like a bumbling idiot.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter careful consideration, I reject outright opting for non-action. While I suppose there are those who might find some utilitarian simplicity in Karl Marx\u2019s belief that \u201clast words are for fools who haven\u2019t said enough,\u201d I\u2019ve spent my whole life rambling on and have found it quite enjoyable so far. Steadfast in my long-established verbosity, I doubt I\u2019ll be dissuaded from speaking out by the passing witticisms of a long-dead Communist.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI want something zippy, perhaps a dash of badass with hints of epic awesomeness. I\u2019m inspired by George Washington\u2019s final adieu, boldly telling his doctor, \u201cI die hard, but I am not afraid to go.\u201d Granted it would be hard for me to compare my life to that of the American Fabius, but a boy can dream. Luckily, bold farewells are not the sole province of the historically significant. James French, famed American criminal sentenced to death by electrocution in the 1960s, allegedly gave one last wink to the peanut gallery before lightning bolted him to the afterlife. \u201cHow\u2019s this for a headline,\u201d he chuckled to onlookers, \u201cFRENCH FRIES.\u201d While I wouldn\u2019t take a convict\u2019s counsel, there is a certain charm in seeing a man who flouted the laws of man spit just the same in the face of Death. I figure if a Southern murderer with a flair for shtick can grab some laughs on the way out, I sure as hell ought to be able to pull it off.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPerhaps it\u2019s that feeling of control that drives me to hope for irreverence in spite of such grave fortunes. I want to know that my relative fearlessness in life was more than just an act, more than empty boastings to show off in front of my buttoned-down coworkers at gallery openings. I\u2019m a strong believer, after all, that if one is afraid to die, they were afraid to truly live. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI hope I get another hundred years to workshop my ultimate quip, and I\u2019m happy for now just to let these daydreams vividly break up the monotony of a morning commute with the imagined heft of a send-off address. With any luck, by the time I really need to worry about it I\u2019ll be so pleased with my life that I won\u2019t need to prove anything else to the world before I leave it. Maybe a quick <i>thank you,</i> or an <i>it\u2019s been fun.</i> But until I find that peace, I\u2019ll continue to strive for irreverence, and I\u2019ll keep preparing cool one-liners to lob at ninjas while everyone else pretends they\u2019re hitting home runs. \r\n<img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day of 1938, a critical game in a ping-pong tournament held in Poland was called off after an embarrassing show of poor sportsmanship. The Warsaw-based team representing Hapoel, a Zionist-socialist sports organization, stood up their opponents in a complex maneuver to bar their rivals, another Jewish athletic club called Morgnshtern, from the second-place title. Although the year of 1938 is charged with historical cataclysms that somewhat overshadow the event of a thwarted game of table tennis, the insult articulated here points to a schism in the maturation of a young movement. The friction between these sports clubs captures two opposing strains of the developing rhetoric of <i>Muskuljudentum</i>\u2014muscular Judaism, at a decisive crossroads. The prewar chapter of muscular Judaism\u2019s narrative lies somewhere in history\u2019s blind spot, and with it, the issue at stake in this unplayed ping-pong game of \u201938.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe offended party, Morgnshtern (Yiddish for \u201cmorning star\u201d), was the offshoot of a political movement whose history spans from fin-de-si\u00e8cle Russia to an abrupt vanishing point brought about by the Second World War. Morgnshtern was the athletic arm of the Polish Bund, a Jewish, socialist labor movement that is distinguished by its core tenet of <i>doykait,</i> or \u201chereness,\u201d the principle that Jews are responsible for developing viable living conditions in their current environments\u2014in this case, Poland and the former Russian Empire. Their program was stringently anti-Zionist, a fact that incited bitter hostility from Hapoel along with many other contemporary Jewish movements, both in the political and athletic arena. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1898, at the Second Zionist Congress in Basel, Max Nordau coined a term that became a sort of slogan for Jewish athletic movements emerging throughout Europe, including both Morgnshtern and its competitors. Nordau called for the patenting of a new prototype for the Jewish body under the banner of <i>muscular Judaism.</i> The muscle Jew is figured as an antithetical response to Martin Buber\u2019s classification of the <i>Ostjude,</i> the \u201cEastern Jew,\u201d who, like some kind of delicate species of butterfly native to the shtetl, can be recognized by his diminutive stature, hypersensitive nerves, and rapid analytical impulse. He\u2019s an inveterate <i>luftmensch,</i> as Yiddish would have it, living in abstraction and inept when faced with the physical constraints of contingency and circumstance. Buber\u2019s category lingers, even now, as an attractive metaphor. The mental and spiritual agility of the <i>Ostjude</i> is strangely confirmed or justified by his archetypal lack of physical sturdiness, making this portrait of the awkwardly endowed Jew a useful myth both for the Jew himself, and for anti-Semitic cartoonists seeking fodder for the Sunday gazette. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNordau\u2019s scheme is motivated: the national regeneration of the Jewish people was to be mapped onto the physical fitness of the individual body. Nordau sieves through biblical tropes to bolster his paradigm with carefully-chosen icons, cashing in on Simon bar Kokhba and the Maccabees as the forefathers of the modern Jew. Even Samson, the world\u2019s original muscle man, comes in handy as a Nazarite devout from birth. This underexploited Biblical figure surfaces in Werner Herzog\u2019s film <i>Invincible,</i> which follows the career of the historical Zishe Breitbart, the \"Strongest Man in the World,\" who hailed from an Orthodox Jewish family of blacksmiths in L\u00f3dz. Although the real Breitbart died in 1925, Herzog scoots his lifetime a decade towards the present for the sake of his parable. He casts Breitbart as the superhuman guardian of the Jewish people at a time when he was most sorely needed and conspicuously absent. The film shows this blue-collar Samson grappling with the rising forces of Nazi mysticism in pre-war Germany, apotheosizing the vaudeville strongman into a Jewish folk hero. As elephants and tigers parade across a plank balanced on his chest, he peacefully picks up Samson\u2019s vocation, this time directed against the Philistines of the twentieth century. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWriting new scenes for Samson into the drama of pre-war Poland boils down Nordau\u2019s mission into a slapstick sketch. But this film reel featuring a swarthy Popeye, a feeble-minded hulk with a heart of gold, is out of step with our formula for picturing 20th century European Jews. After all, the historical Breitbart left his \u201cshtetl\u201d far behind, opting for American citizenship and making his fortune on mail-order muscle toning courses and a guide to fitness, <i>Muscular Power.</i> By fiddling with the facts, Herzog\u2019s film makes it all the clearer how unaccustomed we are to the paradigm Breitbart embodies.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor Nordau, the able-bodied Jew is not the humble son of blacksmiths from L\u00f3dz; he\u2019s a citizen of a new nation. And the project of muscular Judaism is at the service of the greater project of building a Jewish state in Palestine. But the rally to meet his challenge branches into two irreconcilable directions. Most historically legible is the vision of this archetype as a new species for a new territory, claiming Palestine as its stomping grounds. But the Bund\u2019s attempt to actualize this ideal not in a future <i>elsewhere</i> but in its present-day Poland has been swallowed up by a historiography that has no use for it. The mobilization of a Jewish community, Yiddish-speaking but secular, that was not at all tempted by the promises of Palestine is incompatible with the history of Zionist thought. Yet it\u2019s just as inconceivable to historians of Jewish Poland, who can\u2019t quite squint through the screen of the Holocaust to make out the contours of a strong Jewish community that wouldn\u2019t be looking for an exit sign.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGiving the Bund\u2019s project the time of day doesn\u2019t exactly come naturally in a Poland devoid of nearly the entirety of its pre-war Jewish population, a Poland sweeping the wreckage of socialism\u2019s failures under the rug as quickly as possible. The Bund\u2019s book is succinctly closed with the \u201csuicide protest\u201d of its representative in the Polish Government in Exile, Szmul Zygielbojm. In the early morning of May 12th, 1943, upon hearing of the final suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Zygielbojm took his life in a political gesture directed against the indifference of the Allied armies to the genocide of Poland\u2019s Jewry. The Bund\u2019s campaign is punctuated with his devastating suicide letter: \u201cMy life belongs to the Jewish people of Poland,\u201d he writes, \u201cand therefore I hand it over to them now.\u201d But in spite of its implausibility in retrospect, the Bund and Morgnshtern\u2019s attempt at building a muscular Judaism outside and against the rhetoric of Zionism is a rare phenomenon that screams for notice. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe pedagogical value of this lost episode of history would fill a huge crucial gap in the current state of Holocaust education. The visual database that first acquaints Polish children to the tricky category of Polish Jews\u2014those people who lived here but don\u2019t anymore\u2014is a nightmarish collage of the terrified, animal eyes and shaved heads of children prisoners photographed upon their arrival to Auschwitz, snapshots of emaciated Jews found hiding in sewers, and heaps of dead bodies piled in front of gas chambers. For Polish schoolchildren, this catalog of harrowing images constitutes the first impression, and therefore reference point, of an absent Jewish community. This imagery can quickly congeal into a sort of paralysis of pity that precludes all possibilities of actual empathy, and boxes the nearly-millennium long history of Jewish life in Poland into a parenthetical footnote squeezed under the encyclopedic entry for \u201cAuschwitz.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI can\u2019t help but think that the aesthetics of Morgnshtern are sorely missed from this picture. In hindsight, the giant human pyramids, the proud rows of figure skaters, and the spectacle of <i>en masse</i> eurythmics conjure unfortunate associations of fascist gymnastic expositions more readily than they speak to the future of Jewish prosperity in Poland. Met with a moment of patience, however, Morgnshtern fills out the visual trajectory of muscular Judaism. Todd Samuel Presner opens his book on Nordau\u2019s archetype with an analysis of an iconic Life magazine cover depicting a triumphant Israeli soldier at the end of the Six Day War. This bronzed, broad-shouldered soldier basking in the sun and splashing in the newly-conquered waters of the Suez Canal is an essential snapshot of how the muscle Jew prototype circulates in the post-war imaginary. This posterboy of virility and health seems to suggest that the muscle Jew is an exclusively post-war phenomenon. Suddenly, the Samson pin-up who made an early escape is pitched against the mug shot of the malnourished <i>Ostjude</i> who stayed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUnfortunately, fate doesn\u2019t smile upon everyone so fondly as she does on this ruggedly handsome, gun-toting macho bobbing along his very own Suez. Samson himself never made his final exit, perishing instead together with his foes in the collapsed temple of the Philistines. The armed leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising lost their lives in a blown-up bunker, never making it beyond the parameters of the destroyed ghetto. Revisiting the Bund\u2019s project with the optimism it calls for feels a little like penciling in an alternative ending to these stories that have no exit routes.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn his majestic though trying novel <i>See Under: Love,</i> David Grossman does exactly this. Grossman scrutinizes the death of the Polish writer Bruno Schulz with a red pen and the brutal scrutiny of an impossible editor. In the haze of his rapt devotion to this writer, who was shot on a street of the Jewish ghetto in his hometown of Drohobycz in 1942, Grossman follows after Harold in his assumption that all one needs to reverse the unsavory details of history is a trusty purple crayon. He writes his beloved Schulz a comic-book escape map, marked with dotted lines, trapdoors, and a big X denoting the final point of departure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe central section of Grossman\u2019s novel calls Schulz back from the cobwebbed corners of dusky libraries and the opaque depths of Drohobycz\u2019s mass graves. In this epic thought experiment, Schulz transforms into a salmon and joins the ranks of a migrating school of fish. The formula for this rescue mission is fished out from the waters of Schulz\u2019s own prose. In his most peculiarly boyish story, \u201cLoneliness,\u201d narrated by a stubbornly childlike old man, Schulz swears his allegiance to the virtue of trapdoors. For the bubbly old narrator, an easy exit strategy from the idleness of old age is to \u201cimagine a door, a good old door.\u201d He naively promises that \u201cthere is no walled-in room that could not be opened by such a trusted door, provided one were strong enough to suggest that such a door exists.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGrossman takes him up on this proposal, and insinuates an escape route into the huge, walled-in room of the Drohobycz ghetto. He annotates Schulz\u2019s biography with a new plotline, radically changing its ending. In summary, the new draft sounds absurd and off-color, but voiced in the trembling, pre-pubescent voice of Grossman\u2019s childlike idiom, the unlikely getaway plan comes off without a hitch. Schulz, caught planting a wet kiss on Edvard Munch\u2019s \u201cThe Scream\u201d on display in a Danzig museum, is chased by a pack of sinister museum attendants, cops, and SS officers to the end of a dock on the Baltic Sea. Left with no other exit, Schulz hurls himself into the bay. Tagging along with a passing school of salmon, he begins the painful process of both mental and corporeal assimilation. In short, he turns into a fish.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGrossman\u2019s claim that one of the millions of murders comprising the Holocaust can be revised with the stroke of a strong pen calls to mind Dora Garc\u00eda\u2019s 2009 installation \u201cLenny\u2019s Paper,\u201d now included in the collection of the newly-opened Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCAK) in Krak\u00f3w, Poland. The piece consists of 330 stacked copies of the International Herald Tribune, referencing a poorly-received comedy routine in which Lenny Bruce announced that the Jews murdered in the Holocaust are all, as it turns out, alive and well in Argentina. Garc\u00eda\u2019s front page features a photograph of Bruce\u2019s stunt, under the original headline: \u201cSix million Jews found alive in Argentina.\u201d By reproducing Bruce\u2019s routine in black and white print, Garc\u00eda shoves his punch line into an embarrassing position of authority.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGarc\u00eda\u2019s piece is nested in a collection in which Holocaust issues are yanked to the foreground and writ large. This is made aggressively clear from the very beginning: to enter the gallery, visitors have no choice but to walk under Moscow Conceptualist Yuri Albert\u2019s mock-up of the gate from Auschwitz, which spells out in a dreamy wash of neon, \u201c<i>kunst macht frei</i>,\u201d art will make you free. The museum shares a complex with the former factory of Oskar Schindler, today the seat of a year-old museum on the Nazi occupation of Krak\u00f3w. Sensitive to this, and to the fact that the lion\u2019s share of Krak\u00f3w\u2019s annual tourists is drawn by the city\u2019s 70-kilometer proximity to Auschwitz-Birkenau, the museum accepts its responsibility to address these themes wholesale.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWrapped in this context, the assertion that the staggering statistic of Holocaust victims can be reversed at the whim of a single newspaper heading might ring out as crude, cruel and cold. The piece is flanked, however, by an overall impressive collection that relentlessly (and as I see it, successfully) insists on the right to address Holocaust thematics with a measure of humor. I left the museum\u2019s opening in May of this year with the curious impression that maybe what is missing from the dialogue about the Holocaust here in Poland is a sudden gust of balmy Argentine air. This is to say, somewhere between that vibrant image of Bruno Schulz running barefoot down a dock on the sun-dappled Baltic coast and the two-fold irony of Garc\u00eda\u2019s joke, I notice that an always-impossible subject has somehow lost its thick film of unapproachability. Garc\u00eda\u2019s two-tiered fraud becomes a double floor for the jailbreak, not of 6 million Jews, but of everyone trapped in the closed-circuit attitude towards Polish Jews that evolves from terror straight into boredom without ever passing through a threshold of empathy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat is it about the smack of Schulz\u2019s stride on a boardwalk and Grossman\u2019s fable of a Jew\u2019s transmutation into a muscular salmon that has more of a visceral effect than, dare I say, a respectful memorial at the site of Warsaw\u2019s former ghetto? I can\u2019t help but think it has something to do with Grossman\u2019s vote of confidence in the physical fitness and, specifically, the elasticity of the Jewish body. Finding a way to reincorporate the Bund\u2019s athletic campaign into Jewish history education in Poland might prove a creative tactic against this paralysis of pity that, for now, freezes all channels towards understanding.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nJust across the gallery from \u201cLenny\u2019s Paper, visitors consistently linger in front of a video piece by Israeli artist Yael Bartana, entitled \u201cNightmares.\u201d In the video, a Pole delivers a desperate speech, inviting back the three million Jews Poland lost during World War II. The speaker is S\u0142awomir Sierakowski, founder and editor of the journal <i>Krytyka Polityczna</i>(\u201cPolitical Critique\u201d), an influential publication among Polish left-wing intellectuals. Sierakowski stands in Warsaw\u2019s desolate 10th-Anniversary Stadium, a paradigmatic landmark of the architecture of Communist Poland, now completely defunct. \u201cYou think that the old lady sleeping under Rifke\u2019s quilt doesn\u2019t want to see you?\u201d he wails. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. She dreams about you every night.\u201d Sierakowski\u2019s speech is a monologue addressed to today\u2019s diaspora of Polish Jews, which, quite frankly, has no intention of planning a mass exodus back to a place it largely figures as a breeding ground for anti-Semites. His crisp voice clangs off the stadium\u2019s weed-grown walls of empty bleachers, and in turn off the white walls of the spacious gallery. The only audience to soak up his speech is a thin row of scouts onscreen, and now and then a pair of chance spectators ambling through MOCAK\u2019s collection. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn this colossal stadium fallen into disuse, the absence of the Morgnshtern\u2019s collective dance routines and synchronized figure skating displays suddenly seems tragic. Even the steady thump of a ping-pong ball paddled back and forth might help to chip away at the stadium\u2019s silence. If narratives of Jewish history currently figure Poland as a constellation of concentration camps, then to picture it instead as a skyline of empty sports stadiums seems like a step, albeit wobbly, in the right direction.\r\n</p>",

In public, a cascade of people turns very slightly towards her, each an unwitting index that doubles the original reference. The person being waved good-bye, by contrast, signals back at the one waving. Except for that exceptional recipient, puzzled or cautious, pointing to herself, mouthing, \u201cMe?\u201d Or that third case, of the famous cat, who, as the monk waved her good-bye, looked at the moon.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSomeone wiggles a hand at someone who can see it but not hold it. Wave back, please, share how I miss you. Show me your willingness to humor my demand that you show me your loss. But someone who waves good-bye also wiggles a hand at someone who will shortly become unable to see it. Someone draws someone into a clipped gesture. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nImagine, if you will, a world in which waves were not terminated at the horizon of sight. They would end occasionally. We have to get on with things. But the loss and its needy collaborative ostentation could always be revisited, asynchronously between two people for the rest of their lives, as they remembered each other and the wave was passed back and forth. After years they might always pick it up, appending another line to a thousand-page register. You are imagining the world that text-messages are dreaming about.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<iframe width=\"425\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/KQoJo81lujk?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the famous \u201cpoop back and forth\u201d scene from <i>Me and You and Everyone We Know</i>, the little boy Robby generates a fantasy for his brother\u2019s IM adventuring. What\u2019s striking is the way Robby\u2019s fantasy resembles the medium of IM. Indeed, the words and symbols from Robby\u2019s fantasy get passed back to him verbatim the next time he signs in. And when he replies, he himself not only echoes Nancy\u2019s, his chat partner\u2019s, overtures, but literally copies and pastes her text back to her. It really is \u201cthe same poop.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRobby describes the fantasy twice, once spontaneously, and again a little impatiently so that his brother can type it in right. The second time he adds a word: \u201cAnd we will keep doing it. Back and forth. With the same poop. Forever.\u201d Just moments earlier he\u2019d asked his brother what he thought their mother was doing. He can\u2019t see what she\u2019s doing. But Nancy\u2019s first text to them describes what she\u2019s wearing. It doesn\u2019t matter where she is. In his fantasy of eternal asynchronous presence, Robby cashes out the discovery of a new technology of being-with. The \u201cback and forth\u201d of IM allows him rehabilitate absence, even his mother\u2019s: Robby thinks his mother is \u201cbuying them presents,\u201d that is, that her absence contains an inherent momentum towards them, which is not devalued by the fact that it must be experienced asynchronously.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis fantasy is diagrammed in its industry standard representation: speech bubbles back and forth in an unbroken, undifferentiated \u201cthread,\u201d from the first to the last text ever dispatched between two people. This mixed metaphor underlines the ambiguity of this kind of presence: a thread of bubbles? Threads are already ambivalent, an image of both eternity and mortality. But how can a thread of bubbles be cut? A knife or even a barge could pass unnoticed through the gaps of these intimacies. Hence the gratuitousness and even futility of good-byes in this medium. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen people in a text-message conversation die, they either die together or they die apart. Between these two there is no compromise that would correctly represent the way people with cell phones are there for one another. Dying apart doesn\u2019t do justice to their history, which never ended. Dying together is just a coda that adds without culminating anything. Still, it is understandable that the interminable romance of <i>Jeux d'enfants</i> would end in a double-suicide. Likewise the thought of dying alone, full of regrets, is satisfying in its own way. In these fantasies, death tests and violently clarifies the lovers\u2019 ambiguous togetherness. Such clarifications are spurious because they submit one kind of presence to the tests of another. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hunger for more presence has signed a pact with ruinousness. But the violence of this testing is partly what people need from love. To Robby, then, another figure of open-endedness could be opposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nSweet thing, I watch you <br>\r\n\r\nBurn so fast it scares me <br>\r\n\r\nMy game, don't lose me <br>\r\n\r\nCome so far, don't lose me<br>\r\n\r\nIt matters where you are<br>\r\n\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &mdash; Slowdive, \u201cWhen the Sun Hits\u201d \r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> Why do vampires fascinate writers of youth? Partly as an opportunity <a href=\"http://www.bearparade.com/nosferatu/four.html\">to play pranks on age</a> and to indulge,  as if it were the fruit of many years, a sententiousness they can\u2019t take help taking seriously. Partly for their hungry, evil, deep histrionic resources, as in the Strokes\u2019 \u201cHeart in a Cage\u201d: \u201cIt\u2019s three in the morning / and you\u2019re eating alone.\u201d   Partly, too, because being eternal makes vampires closer to loss, and not just because they will outlive any human lover. More germane is the fact that they will outlive even romances with their kind&mdash;but only by outliving them into open-endedness. And in this case, eternality also burdens them with a presence to which they can do no lasting damage. More time will always undo the work of their anger. So they are bound to loss doubly, by impermanence and by frustrated ruinousness. They must suffer absence but cannot escape presence. Back and forth. Forever. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is lust for devastation that opens Slowdive\u2019s vampire song, \u201cWhen the Sun Hits.\u201d \u201cSweet thing, I watch you / burn so fast it scares me.\u201d The guitars\u2019 murkily flanged and washed-out brightness is easily read representationally, as the Leitmotif of the sun passing the horizon, and, especially, of the burning body of the vampire girlfriend. The other watches like it\u2019s porn, as his open-endedness is destructively clarified. He sings like he\u2019s on a beach.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut the whole scene goes on, in full whiteness, in some kind of stasis, with only two stanzas repeating. He\u2019s still singing, \u201cSweet thing I watch you,\u201d as the song fades out. The attempt to end open-endedness just becomes another interminable wave. \u201cWhen the sun hits, she\u2019ll [still] be waiting.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSome kind of whirlpool arrests his violence, and the verse ends with a bewilderingly minimal confession, which is also the most memorable line of the song: \u201cIt matters where you are.\u201d It is asserted the way something is asserted when it is arguable. Today this fragility seems prescient. But perhaps in a song that explodes waiting at its last instant, what is significant is the statement\u2019s tense. <!--\u201cIt matters where you are.\u201d Your half-presence is real, but your absence still matters. Even where a good-bye lasts forever, someone must have been departing. --><img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n",

            "rendered_content": "<p>There are several shots in Sofia Coppola\u2019s <i>Somewhere</i>\u00a0that seem especially representative of the director\u2019s central preoccupations: Johnny Marco\u2019s car, circling an empty racetrack; the two identical twin pole dancers performing their act with rote but starstruck enthusiasm; Marco\u2019s face itself, covered in a plaster mold as he drifts into sleep\u2014all these are static moving images: images that become what they are only when we become aware of their unnecessary persistence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The passage of a certain quantity of time generates a new quality of experience. Our eyes glance around the frame looking for point on which to anchor our gaze. If we become uncomfortable it is because we don\u2019t know where to look or how to feel\u2014perhaps we have failed to interpret the image correctly, perhaps our attention has for a moment faded, producing a gap in what should be a seamless aesthetic experience. And when our attention returns, the chain of visual signifiers has been broken and we are brought back to a single moving image, devoid of context or meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This failure of interpretation can\u2019t be blamed on the hyperstimulation characteristic of contemporary media society or the resultant inability of modern movie-goers to sit still and be patient. In fact, this boredom has very little to do with the long tracking shots found in, say, a Tarkovsky movie, which still rely on our ability to read traditional narrative and filmic categories and techniques. It is a boredom of rapt fascination, in which we unsuccessfully attempt to \u201cfully enjoy\u201d the reality of an image that persists in its presence, yet refuses to yield any self-justification, or unfold into some more fully realized affective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Coppola, this stasis stands for the problem of excessive wealth\u2014a stasis in excess of the ascetic bourgeois drive to put wealth into motion, to not let it go to waste, to make something of one\u2019s life. It is the stillness that the rich attempt to escape by immersing themselves in one or another contingent activity or project, whether an altruistic project such as charity or volunteerism (towards the end of the movie, Marco\u2019s wife suggests that he do volunteer work) or a narcissistic project such as exercise or weight loss. Only as long as metabolism (the metabolism bragged about by the \u201cnon-anorexic\u201d bimbo character in Lost in Translation) is able to keep on par with accumulation, and only the extent that the rich are willing to put themselves to work, is excessive wealth justified. For the bourgeoisie, Nietzschean master morality is fundamentally impossible\u2014when it is attempted it only results in neurotic anxieties and violent outbursts (such as those played out by the Jeff Daniels character in Noah Baumbach\u2019s <i>The Squid and the Whale</i>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This gap is the obverse of all productive accumulation and takes the outward appearance of waste. Waste appears not only in the form of the empty houses of the rich or the waste products of mass consumption (the pile of trays Marco finds in his room when he returns home from Las Vegas, the overflowing pot of spaghetti he cooks for himself), but also as lost time\u2014moments whose beauty can never be appreciated unreflexively, but only with a tinge of tragic, preemptive nostalgia. Towards the end of <i>Somewhere</i>\u00a0Marco and his daughter Cleo sit next to each other by the pool of the Chateau Marmont, their eyes hidden under their dark sunglasses. The nostalgic Strokes song we hear tells us that this moment is already a blissful memory, even though it ostensibly takes place in the \u201cpresent\u201d of the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two ways in which bourgeois culture can address this gap (between bourgeois virtue and the excessive wealth this virtue attempts to legitimate): on the one hand, it can attempt to bridge it, to affirm bourgeois ascetic values, and on the other hand, it can declare it unbridgeable, affirming this gap as decadent amoral <i>jouissance</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surest way to shore up the existential crises of bourgeois culture is to resort to family values. Wes Anderson is perhaps the most reprehensible of haute-bourgeois stylists since his family dramas remain so slavishly Oedipal\u2014fathers are consistently accomplished and their tragicomic shortcomings run no deeper than their failures to be more sensitive and understanding toward their neurotic progeny. In Anderson\u2019s films there is a homogeneity between the stylistic choices the director makes to create his cinematic world and the aesthetic values of the characters themselves. These values are thereby naturalized, and the films\u2019 satisfactory resolution of Oedipal conflicts further affirm their cultural worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of affirming bourgeois values by coding them in terms of a \u201cdeeper\u201d Oedipal drama, Sofia Coppola puts these values on display in all their post-Oedipal banality. Marco, the father figure in Somewhere, is castrated from the beginning of the film. His arm is wrapped in a cast, and his sexual misadventures are no mystery to his daughter Cleo, who reacts to them with pointed scorn. Cleo, by contrast, skates beautifully, prepares a flawless eggs benedict breakfast, and fakes all the poise she needs to comport herself in the adult world. If the values of this world are most perfectly and beautifully realized in the figure of a child, it seems impossible to be virtuous in it as an adult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of Sofia Coppola\u2019s characters are like upper-class Bartlebies, refusing or unable to \u201cmake something\u201d of their lives and their privilege. As bearers of beauty, wealth or fame these characters are expected to live up to the fantasies projected onto them as celebrity objects of collective desire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Celebrities, we believe, should be \u201cjust like us\u201d only more disciplined, more ascetic, more objectified. They should accept media scrutiny and public voyeurism as the necessary price of their fame and social position. And the wealth they enjoy is acceptable because it is not only their own but also the public\u2019s, at least insofar as it is able to consume and enjoy their image.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The celebrity who withholds himself from public view is eroticized all the more, since the tiny scraps we can salvage of his life are given value in proportion to their rarity. This is an important theme in Coppola\u2019s <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>, and though the movie portrays a family in 1970s suburban Michigan (rather than a Hollywood Star), the Lisbon girls\u2019 existence is fully mediated by television and celebrity culture. The demands that these girls and their family be on display, that they give some account of themselves to the public, and that their actions appear intelligible are placed on them both by the local TV channel and by the young boys who watch them from afar. Yet these are demands that can never be satisfied. The girls \u201cjust want to be girls.\u201d They are expected to possess some secret understanding, power, or perfection and if their suicide appears necessary it is because it is the only way the other characters can sustain the belief in their mystique. From the narration at the beginning of the film, we know that the boys attribute a grand historical significance to the Lisbon girls, attempting to find in their deaths an anticipation of \u201ceverything that happened to their town\u201d\u2014in short, the decline of the auto industry and of U.S. economic hegemony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This interpretation takes on a bitter note when we remember the penultimate scene of the film, in which the boys fantasize about driving away with the Lisbon girls in some kind of Great American Roadtrip. Instead of a car escape, the girls choose death. . . And given the opening shots of the movie, which are like a fast forward recap of <i>Badlands</i>\u00a0(Lux standing in the middle of her street at us over her lollipop) and <i>Blue Velvet</i>\u00a0(the tracking shots of suburban lawns, the ambulance pulling up at the Lisbon home)\u2014two movies featuring bad car trips and an ominous take on American male fantasies of rebellion and escape\u2014who can blame them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the parallels between the fantasy ending of <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>\u00a0and the \u201creal\u201d ending of <i>Somewhere</i>, Johnny Marco\u2019s ridiculous walk into the sunset now appears at the very least more interesting than it does on a naive viewing. Marco\u2019s cowboy charade is about as convincing as Bill Murray\u2019s impressions of Roger Moore and the Rat Pack in <i>Lost in Translation</i>\u2014an outdated Hollywood clich\u00e9 that can only be repeated as farce. What will happen to Marco\u2019s daughter? Will Marco return to Las Vegas via helicopter to pick her up from summer camp? Will he try to play father to a girl to whom he clearly has so little to offer? Or is the final scene of Somewhere as much an imaginative act on the part of Cleo as the car scene in <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>\u00a0is an imaginative act on the part of the young boys\u2014an attempt to transform what is actually Johnny her father\u2019s suicide into a meaningful \u201cway out\u201d? <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<h3>Theoretical Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>In his later works, Foucault elaborates a flexible and suggestive framework through which to think the history of ethics. He suggests that we analyze ethical experience along three axes: the relationship of the ethical subject to truth, his relationship to himself, and his relations with others. A few examples will help to show both the breadth and the complexity of this framework.</p>\r\n<p>Consider the ethical constitution of a typical American upper-middle-class youth, one who seeks to find happiness through self-fulfillment in productive work and loving relationships. Such a subject has a particular relationship to a form of truth which is ethically operative: he must discover the nature and value of his desires and talents insofar as they orient him toward a way of life which will bring him pleasure, fulfillment, and \u201cmeaning.\u201d He might spend a good deal of time wondering about himself and what he really wants, or seek out a variety of experiences in order to discover his place in the world. The truth he seeks here, however, is subordinated to the task of cultivating himself as a good and happy person, the effort to develop his talents and achieve his goals. His relations with others, too, gain their particular ethical weight in the context of this self-cultivation: as an intimate space, a private sphere in which he can achieve self-expression\u2014and not, for example, as a locus of duty or even of etiquette\u2014these relations attain an important but subordinate place in his ethical project.</p>\r\n<p>Now consider the ethical experience of, say, a Marxist revolutionary. For a Marxist, the relation of self to others attains pivotal ethical importance, but this relation in no way resembles that of the subject of self-fulfillment to his friends: the relation of self to others here is political. The Marxist aims to transform society, and his efforts to provoke others to political consciousness orient his ethical subjectivity. This effort, however, is inextricably linked with a particular, ethically significant truth: the truth of the immanent contradictions within bourgeois society, along with the dangers and opportunities these represent. This truth in turn polarizes the relationship of self to self: the self is to be understood as a historically determined and potentially political being, and its significance or lack thereof is thought within the vast nexus of economy and history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an ethics of self-realization, the relationship of self to self might be called primary (though such a relation is unthinkable without the orientation it takes from self-knowledge and the manifestation it seeks in relation to others); in the Marxist experience, the relation of self to others rules (though not without the particular truth which gives it content or the self-understanding which orients it). These examples are thus almost wholly heterogeneous: they differ not only in the nature of each axis (truth of self vs. truth of history, others as intimates vs. others as humans, self as \u201ctrue self\u201d vs. self as partisan) but even in the relations among the axes. A theory which sought to explain both of these forms of experience would be entirely devoid of content.</p>\r\n<p>Foucault\u2019s framework is not a theory, however; it is a method. As such, its purpose is not to contain the heterogeny of ethical experience but to render this heterogeny visible. It seems natural to write the history of ethics as a series of theories of the human good or of moral obligation together with the practice determined by such theories; Foucault suggests that such a history would render invisible the most profound events in the history of ethics, because it would take the relationship of the subject to truth as a primary given and leave it unthought. Yet even in the brief examples above, we can see that this constant is illusory: the Marxist and the seeker of fulfillment differ not merely in which truths they believe but in what kinds of truth they take to be ethically active and how these truths orient the individual as ethical subject. A history of ethics, before it is a history of this or that truth about man\u2019s estate, must seek out, within a given culture, the nature and <i>function</i> of ethical truth as such.</p>\r\n<p>Foucault\u2019s framework provides us with the questions and distinctions with which to recognize and preserve radical heterogeneity in the history of ethics. A history which fails to recognize this heterogeneity risks reading modern ethical experience backwards and forwards into eternity; it likewise necessarily fails to grasp the specificity (the singularity and strangeness) of the present. To comprehend this specificity is perhaps the primary political function of history.</p>\r\n<p>Most of Foucault\u2019s published work in the last years of his life focuses on Stoic and Epicurean ethical practices in the ancient world, which take as their task the \u201ccare of the self.\u201d In these practices, self-knowledge is practiced in the interest of reason\u2019s sovereignty, which is held to promise freedom and happiness. These practices are at once very far from us and oddly familiar; we, too, seek happiness through knowledge and sovereignty, though the sorts of knowledge and happiness we seek are very different. Below I will offer a brief analysis of an ethical practice which is much closer to us historically: the method of prayer practiced by Saint Teresa of Avila. If Stoicism, as \u201ccare of the self,\u201d seems deceptively familiar to us, St. Teresa\u2019s ethic should appear much less comprehensible: for her, prayer as proper care of the self is the practice of self-destruction.</p>\r\n<h3>Section 1</h3>\r\n<p>St. Teresa of Avila was born to a well-off family in Spain in 1515 and died in 1582, a Carmelite nun and a famous mystic. Hours after her death, her followers began to divide up her corpse; fingers, feet, elbows and eyelashes were shipped off to the four corners of Europe to sanctify cathedrals with their presence. Her followers\u2019 devotion may appear rather pagan to our deeply Protestant sensibility, but they were quite logical on their own terms: they believed Teresa\u2019s flesh could make a place holy because they thought she touched God when she prayed.</p>\r\n<p>Today, we understand prayer as a request the believer addresses to God. But in Counter-Reformation Catholicism, the practice of prayer meant something quite different: it was not a way of gaining the favor of God but an elaborated method of meditation aimed at opening the soul to the Word. As such, this practice attained central importance in the contemplative religious life of the regular clergy; monasteries were organized around it, books were written on it, various strains of it were deemed eminently valuable or dangerously heretical. St. Teresa was both one of the most famous practitioners and one of the most influential theoreticians of this practice.</p>\r\n<p>But what, precisely, is the goal of prayer? What does it mean to open the soul to God\u2019s truth? Prayer does not, of course, arouse belief in the subject; profound, unequivocal faith in God is not a consequence but a presupposition of this practice. Contemplative prayer rests on the understanding that such faith is insufficient\u2014or rather, that something in the subject is profoundly resistant to it. Prayer seeks to make the subject adequate to this truth.</p>\r\n<p>The stern Christian doctrine of the Counter-Reformation may be summarized in three points:</p>\r\n<p>1. The sole good for humanity is to love God and obey His commandments. All else is vanity. Absolutely nothing of this world is of value; work, family, worldly honor are at best tests for one\u2019s faith in God. The ideal life is the monastic one, because it is farthest from the so-called goods of this world. The ideal Christian, as St. Teresa never tires of repeating, despises this world.</p>\r\n<p>2. Despite the nothingness of the world, humans are intrinsically too weak to abandon it. We cling to its petty nothings, seek a happiness we won\u2019t find and ignore God. Humans are too weak to despise the world and ought for this reason to despise themselves as selves.</p>\r\n<p>3. Despite the vileness of humanity, God continues to love us and desire our happiness. Therefore He sent his Son to die for us, for the sins that we have already committed and those that we will continue to commit. His terrible and blameless suffering is the price of our sins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problematic of truth in this strain of Christianity is already obvious: faith is at once the one thing needful and essentially unobtainable by the human insofar as he is human. Humans are subject to the delusion that their lives have merit, likewise to the delusion that worldly happiness exists. We are blinded to God\u2019s truth by our very selves; to believe in oneself, to like oneself, to be a self is quite simply to turn from God. The truth\u2014the nothingness of the self, the all-ness of God\u2014is one which, as selves, we cannot attain. We are all too at home in the world. Contemplative prayer aims at this truth; as such, it aims to destroy the self. This is an impossible, or rather an infinite task.</p>\r\n<h3>Section 2</h3>\r\n<p>St. Teresa\u2019s fullest expression of her practice comes in her autobiography, written on the instructions of her confessor for the benefit of those who would follow her path. She describes the path of prayer here by means of an elaborate metaphor:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>The beginner must think of himself as of one setting out to make a garden in which the Lord is to take His delight, yet in soil most unfruitful and full of weeds. His Majesty uproots the weeds and will set good plants in their stead. Let us suppose that this is already done\u2014that a soul has resolved to practice prayer and has already begun to do so. We have now, by God's help, like good gardeners, to make these plants grow, and to water them carefully, so that they may not perish, but may produce flowers which shall send forth great fragrance to give refreshment to this Lord of ours, so that He may often come into the garden to take His pleasure and have His delight among these virtues.</p>\r\n<p>Let us now consider how this garden can be watered, so that we may know what we have to do, what labor it will cost us, if the gain will outweigh the labor,and for how long this labor must be borne. It seems to me that the garden can be watered in four ways: by taking the water from a well, which costs us great labor; or by a water-wheel and buckets, when the water is drawn by a windlass (I have sometimes drawn it in this way: it is less laborious than the other and gives more water); or by a stream or a brook, which waters the ground much better, for it saturates it more thoroughly and there is less need to water it often, so that the gardener's labor is much less; or by heavy rain, when the Lord waters it with no labor of ours, a way incomparably better than any of those which have been described.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The four stages of prayer correspond to these four ways of watering the garden. This metaphor contains a strange and telling reduplication of the self: the religious seeker is at once the soil in which flowers will grow for the Lord\u2019s pleasure and the gardener responsible for watering these flowers. Yet the flowers themselves are planted, not by the seeker, but by God: we do not choose the good, and cannot do it, without his help. The self, then, is not precisely the garden but the rocky soil which God will cause to bear fruit.</p>\r\n<p>But the self has another role, too: as the gardener who waters the flowers. She does not possess the land and does not grow the flowers for her own sake, but she retains an obligation for their well-being. What does she aim at, what does she prepare for in this role? She aims for her own disappearance: for the form of prayer which is like rain soaking the ground of its own accord. In the progress of prayer, the subject as agent disappears step by step until nothing is left but the now fruitful soil, soaking in the water of the Lord.</p><p>Teresa goes on to explain that the water is our tears.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Section 3</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us examine the stages more closely.</p>\r\n<p>1. Mental prayer. This form of prayer consists in the sustained and methodical contemplation of the Passion of Christ. For such contemplation, elaborate methods were developed in Renaissance Christianity: the faithful were advised to imagine the sights, the smells, the despair of the stages of the Cross, to learn which bones and ligaments in Christ\u2019s hands were torn when he was nailed to it. This is the entry into prayer for Teresa, too: she has a vision of Christ on the Mount of Olives and falls at his feet, sobbing at her own wickedness.</p>\r\n<p>The contemplation of the suffering of Christ always interpellates the believer doubly. On the one hand, we are asked to recognize Christ as our ideal: Teresa recommends that the believer should desire nothing more than to assume his Cross and bear his burdens, and she herself often longs to die a thousand deaths in his name. But Christ, of course, is suffering for us: the paradox of God\u2019s death is the horrifying mirror in which we see our own sin. To be <i>worthy</i> of this sacrifice, to accept a gift already given, is the task of the Christian. Or rather: to encounter his unworthiness, to live with this terrible guilt in one\u2019s mind at every moment, is the task of the first stage of prayer.</p>\r\n<p>In the first stage, he seeks to teach himself (a) that he is miserable; (b) that he is <i>worthy</i> of his misery; (c) that he is incapable of deserving better. This is perhaps the singular contribution of Christianity to the long, strange history of ascetic practice.</p>\r\n<p>2. The Prayer of Quiet. Teresa recommends that the beginner ought to be fully satisfied with the first stage and should by no means seek anything higher than impotence. What is higher? The prayer of quiet begins when the subject\u2019s straining is suddenly taken away because God relieves him (temporarily, alas!) of his will. The other faculties, imagination and the intellect, continue to operate, distracting him\u2014but he no longer needs to make the choice to contemplate God; God is his only desire. The gardener\u2019s work grows easier.</p>\r\n<p>3. The Devotion of Union. In this stage, the will\u2019s disappearance is accompanied by that of the imagination, memory, and intellect; the self dissolves into God. Teresa says this very sweetly of memory: \u201cSo the restless little moth of the memory has its wings burned, and can flutter no more.\u201d The third stage is perhaps the sweetest. Teresa cannot comprehend it, but she tells us that God has explained it to her: \u201c[The soul] dissolves utterly, my daughter, to rest more and more in Me. It is no longer itself that lives; it is I. As it cannot comprehend what it understands, it understands by not understanding.\u201d The soul attains the joy of a resonant and glorious silence.</p>\r\n<p>Such union cannot last, however; it too utterly erases the subject, and as such it is misleading. The promised identity between believer and God cannot occur among the living; the highest understanding of truth to which a living human can attain is the experience not of peace but of exile.</p>\r\n<p>4. The Devotion of Rapture. Teresa describes rapture as an unimaginable suffering: the experience of the world itself as absolutely empty of warmth and value, combined with the knowledge that one is abandoned there. To be raised to this height is to be \u201ccrucified between earth and heaven,\u201d or rather (as St. Paul describes it) to be \u201ccrucified unto the world.\u201d In this stage, \u201cGod so strips [the soul] of everything that, strive though it may, it can find no companion on earth. Nor indeed does it wish for one; it would rather die in its solitude.\u201d The very desire for companionship is a product of weakness: \u201cBy speaking of its pain, and complaining and seeking distractions, the soul is endeavoring to live, though much against the will of the spirit.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>But to be so utterly filled with a longing for that which one can never attain\u2014Teresa\u2019s story of her life reads at times like a love letter.</p>\r\n<p>\u201cO supreme cunning of the Lord, with what delicate skill did You work on Your miserable slave! You hid Yourself from me, and out of Your love You afflicted me with so delectable a death that my soul desired it never to cease.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>St. Teresa had many visions\u2014she lived for weeks at a time in certainty of Christ\u2019s bodily presence\u2014but her most famous is this one:</p>\r\n<Blockquote>\r\nIt pleased the Lord that I should see this angel in the following way. He was not tall, but short, and very beautiful, his face so aflame that he appeared to be one of the highest types of angel who seem to be all afire. They must be those who are called cherubim: they do not tell me their names but I am well aware that there is a great difference between certain angels and others, and between these and others still, of a kind that I could not possibly explain. In his hands I saw a long golden spear and at the end of the iron tip I seemed to see a point of fire. With this he seemed to pierce my heart several times so that it penetrated to my entrails. When he drew it out, I thought he was drawing them out with it and he left me completely afire with a great love for God. The pain was so sharp that it made me utter several moans; and so excessive was the sweetness caused me by this intense pain that one can never wish to lose it, nor will one's soul be content with anything less than God. It is not bodily pain, but spiritual, though the body has a share in it -- indeed, a great share. So sweet are the colloquies of love which pass between the soul and God.</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThe highest form of prayer is this sweet and endless suffering. It is said that in her raptures, St. Teresa would be lifted on the ground and suspended in mid-air. Many nuns witnessed this and confirmed these stories. I do not think that she really levitated, but I am sure that those who said they saw it were not lying.</p>\r\n<h3>Section 4</h3>\r\n<h3>Relation to Truth</h3>\r\n<p>It is oddly easy to forget that Christian ethical thought is oriented entirely around the subject\u2019s relation to truth\u2014that faith is the one thing needful. In St. Teresa\u2019s thought, right action (duty) and happiness (eternal bliss) maintain significance not as goals to be sought in their own right but as consequences of right worship. The endless task of prayer is to comprehend God\u2019s love and the subject\u2019s perfidy; all else falls by the wayside.</p>\r\n<p>Yet this very practice of prayer, through its inwardness, its exclusive relationship to the subject\u2019s knowledge and salvation, begets a secondary elaboration of the relation to truth: a hermeneutics designed to guarantee the authenticity of the knowledge and experience developed in prayer. After all, nuns went into hysterics all the time in the Middle Ages, and the Catholic clergy were keenly aware that not every fainting fit came from God. Some were mere madness, others heresy; during St. Teresa\u2019s lifetime, women were burned at the stake for professing to have experiences very much like her own. She is terrified that her visions may be temptations from the Devil. Such a risk was\u00a0 all the more pressing because some of them made her happy: Why, indeed, should God favor her? She could not doubt her visions, but neither could she guarantee them on her own authority: the truth they seemed to reveal was not her truth but God\u2019s. Thus a religion of inwardness, of a faith which addresses the individual in his radical solitude, generates a network of social relations designed to authenticate individual experience.</p>\r\n<h3>Relation to Others\u00a0</h3>\r\n<p>St. Teresa lived her life in a nunnery, under the absolute authority of her prioress and her (male) confessors. When she first began to see things, she waged a long and disturbing battle with her confessors on the subject. She could not believe that such things could come from the devil, but they were convinced of it. She won\u2014her canonization, a mere 40 years after her death, is evidence enough of this. Under what conditions was it possible to mediate between the absolutely universal dictates of the church and the radically singular, even incommunicable, experience of the rapture? There were three such conditions:</p>\r\n<p>1. Confession. Given that human beings, such as they are, are inadequate to the truth, constantly deceived by pride and vanity, confession plays a central role in Catholic mystical practice. The individual may be deceived, but his confessor cannot be, because Confession is a sacrament: it is guaranteed by Christ himself. St. Teresa won her cause in large part because she convinced her confessors.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n2. Virtue. In St. Teresa\u2019s writing, good works and the care of souls are thought not as the center of ethical practice but as a sign of its progress. She asks\u2014how could the Devil send visions which make me act more righteously, or which allow me to show wicked men the light? \u201cYou shall know the tree by its fruit.\u201d Yet prayer is not oriented toward such good works; to save one\u2019s soul is an end in itself. Good works\u2014the entire edifice of human relations\u2014have value primarily as signifiers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n3. Dogma. Teresa says again and again that if her visions were to contradict Church dogma in the least detail, she would know them as Satanic right away. Christ himself cannot (or rather, would never) contradict the teachings of his church. We forget what dogma meant in Catholic Europe; we forget even the possibility of an ethically obligatory limitation on thought.\r\n<h3>Relation to Self</h3>\r\nDogma, confession, and works provide the necessary link between the truth of individual experience as revealed in prayer and the Word as it is written. This dogma underlies what we might call the two antinomies of Catholic ethical experience.</p>\r\n<p>The first of these, the antinomy of freedom, might be expressed as follows: the subject is always sovereign enough to sin, but never free enough to do good without grace. Catholic dogma constitutes the subject as <i>ineradicably</i> guilty, and such ineradicable guilt is unthinkable\u2014or rather, not to be thought. Whenever St. Teresa describes herself doing something good\u2014breaking off a distracting friendship, say, or eliminating a bad habit\u2014she thanks God for granting her the strength to do it; yet when any evil befalls her, it is she herself who must bear the blame. If the Devil himself tempts her, he is permitted to do so because of her sins. The subject\u2019s sovereignty, evil as such, can do nothing but evil.</p>\r\n<p>The second antinomy is that of humility. St. Teresa distinguishes between \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d humility, and inveighs against the latter. This false humility is not what we might guess from our own experience, the nasty habit of priding oneself on one\u2019s self-effacement, but something stranger. In her youth, St. Teresa was tempted to cease practicing prayer because it gave her too much pleasure, more than a sinful creature like her could ever deserve; this, she says, is false humility. The falsely humble woman believes herself incapable of receiving God\u2019s grace. This, even though the <i>true</i> humility\u2014the belief that one is <i>unworthy</i> of God\u2019s grace\u2014is the primary condition of salvation. The faithful must never believe that they have earned grace, yet they must always be ready to receive it.</p>\r\n<p>These paired unthinkabilities\u2014the absolute wickedness of man as free, the absolute love of God for such creatures\u2014orient a spiritual practice aimed at the erasure of the subject. The gardener has absolute responsibility for the garden which he tends so poorly\u2014but only as a caretaker awaiting the rain which will replace him.</p>\r\n<h3>Afterword</h3\r\n<p>\r\nOur culture has forgotten Christian mysticism, almost entirely and surprisingly quickly. Perhaps we should congratulate ourselves. Our ethical practices, in their teeming variety, aim one and all at happiness in this life, and they mostly seek it through an apotheosis of selfhood; to become what one is in the time that one has is our goal, and even our Christians expect a reward for their efforts. But we should not forget that Kant had the judgment of twenty centuries behind him when he wrote: \u201cIf we calculate the value of a human life in the pleasure it gives to the one who lives it, its value will be less than nothing.\u201d The experience of Teresa of Avila, morbid and frightening though it is at times, speaks to a very old human desire: the will to be freed from the sorry shell of selfhood, to be penetrated and consumed by the divine. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>Johnny Marco, the protagonist of Sofia Coppola\u2019s <i>Somewhere</i>, is often behind the wheel. In these scenes, his profile is fixed before an ever-changing background as the world rolls past his window. The unrelenting progress of his Ferrari churns urban sprawl and desert landscape to a uniform blur, and we come to understand this perpetual movement as emblematic of a certain lifestyle. Existence for the bored and wealthy, it seems, is an endless stream of stimuli, bereft of significance and pleasure\u2014a luxurious cruise in which the particulars of the journey are irrelevant, perhaps even antithetical, to its purpose.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <i><i>Somewhere</i></i>, sexual gratification is essential to this sensibility. The plot enlists a parade of women whose titillating attempts to dislodge Johnny\u2019s anomie are met with occasional enthusiasm but inevitable failure. The identical twin strippers who grin and twirl before him in his hotel room, the earnest fan whose physical appeal is not enough to keep him from passing out in her pelvis, his jilted Italian lover\u2014these women are all performing before his lustful, overindulged gaze. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In last month\u2019s issue, David Richter put forth the following interpretation of <i><i>Somewhere</i></i>\u2019s lengthy shots: \u201cIt is a boredom of rapt fascination, in which we unsuccessfully attempt to \u2018fully enjoy\u2019 the reality of an image that persists in its presence, yet refused to yield any self-justification, or unfold into some more fully realized affective.\u201d This reading, when applied to the film\u2019s sexual element, grants a slightly different insight. The languid camera work is meant to evoke the mindless lust of the protagonist. Johnny Marco gazes with desire at several women, but that desire is never sufficient to dispel his ultimate boredom and unhappiness. During those static scenes, we are at first engaged by what we see on-screen, and then succumb to Marco\u2019s ennui: these sights are old, even hackneyed by the time the scene changes and the gaze is trained on some new object. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that gaze\u2014which is mimicked so adeptly by <i>Somewhere</i>\u2019s protracted, lingering shots\u2014is complicated by at least one factor: his 11-year-old daughter, Cleo. In her 1975 essay \u201cVisual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,\u201d the feminist Laura Mulvey posits a psychoanalytic theory of the role of women in mainstream film. The success of a typical Hollywood movie relies on what she calls the \u201cmale gaze\u201d: an assumed male, heterosexual perspective. This transforms the leading lady (or potentially any on-screen woman) into an erotic object both for the film\u2019s characters and for the audience. This interrupts the diegesis in the interest of offering a sensuous diversion, while inviting viewers to identify with the male protagonist and his sexual desire.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, the \u201cmale gaze\u201d of the spectator and the leading man are forever elided, creating a pleasurable tension based on male lust\u2019s transcendence of narrative boundaries. Such a neat combination is most easily achieved when the plot calls for a female character to be a dancer, singer, or other performer, creating an excuse for \u201cperformance\u201d scenes whose principal purpose is titillation. The implications of Mulvey\u2019s paradigm flirt with taboo, however, when we are reminded that Johnny Marco\u2019s consistent female companion, the woman whose ice-skating performances and handstands enrapture him, is not his sexual match but his own prepubescent daughter.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not to suggest that <i>Somewhere</i> is actually about incest\u2014certainly Johnny Marco never makes a sexual advance on Cleo and does not struggle with the accompanying guilt. Rather, Coppola presents a man whose sexualized gaze struggles to conform to a reality in which his daughter, on the eve of her own sexual development, will soon be at the mercy of male desire. Marco acts as a symbol of our culture\u2019s objectifying tendency, and his self-contempt marks the inability of such a view to accommodate the complexities of intimacy and fatherhood. By the film\u2019s end, Marco is repulsed, at least in part, by his complicity in a system that will ultimately debase his own daughter. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, much of <i>Somewhere</i> is devoted to establishing Cleo as a tween analogue to the women who populate Johnny\u2019s sex life. Near the beginning, we see a bored Johnny Marco reclining on his hotel bed, staring listlessly at the aforementioned twin strippers who are shinnying up the poles erected in his room. This arrangement conforms to Mulvey\u2019s concept of the performing woman. The scene is oversaturated with sexual desire\u2014Johnny is presented with not one, but two identical dancers. They are situated before a mirror, as if to double the erotic effect and to illustrate a universe in which male lust is always gratified. This may very well be true, because\u2014like the landscape outside the window of his sports car\u2014women in Johnny\u2019s life are seemingly identical, replaceable, and endlessly proliferating.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This illusion is shattered when the scene cuts to him waking up to his daughter writing her name on his arm cast and drawing a heart. Soon after, he watches her manipulate her nimble form in an ice-skating routine; her flourishes present a na\u00efve version of the pole dance shown scarcely a minute before. As with the strippers, Johnny looks on with a mix of boredom and detached amusement as his daughter glides and spins for his approval. After a series of dramatic leg-lifts that seem especially adult, his smile fades and he furrows his brow. His male gaze has been interrupted, challenged even, by what it is taking in. He has been made abruptly aware of Cleo\u2019s imminent sexual maturation, a process that seems to have begun entirely unbeknownst to him. On the car ride back to her mother\u2019s house, he asks when she learned how to ice-skate. Her unflinching response: \u201cI\u2019ve been going for three years.\u201d </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cleo\u2019s repeated brushes with her father\u2019s sex life are a source of permanent tension, a fact that serves to dismantle the assumed male gaze by inflecting it with the perverse. A reporter asks, \u201cWho\u2019s Cleo,\u201d referring to the name on Johnny\u2019s cast. The tone of his question hints at some imagined scandalous liaison, one that befits the actor\u2019s macho persona. Here, we see our protagonist not as a womanizing villain, but as a product of a culture that assumes, even demands, his misbehavior. Johnny glances down at his cast\u2014at his daughter\u2019s name written in childish cursive, at the other names scrawled in debauched imitation of the original, at the heart that now seems symbolic of a different kind of love. He purses his lips and sheepishly admits that Cleo is a child\u2014his child.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is at moments like this, when incest casts its ominous shadow upon the details of their interaction, that Cleo and Johnny\u2019s relationship must alter its outward appearance. Cleo often plays mother to her own father, who is happy to be infantilized. This may be an unconscious attempt to dispel any suggested sexual undertones, to reach an equilibrium of sorts; the midway point between a sex object and a doting matriarch may be a well-intentioned daughter. Cleo prepares eggs Benedict for Johnny, loses graciously to him at <i>Guitar Hero</i> as he takes puerile pride in his victory, and makes polite conversation with his friends who come over to play. In this world, women were created to serve him in either the bedroom or the kitchen, and he cannot seem to conceive of a scenario in which they can demand something of him in return.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, however, he buckles under the weight of a reality that has locked him in the same performing role. Any satisfaction he receives from the pole dancers writhing before him is negated by the fact that he, too, is reduced to an object by the gaze of the public. After all, he is an actor. His duty is to assume several roles on-screen, to be a male parallel to Mulvey\u2019s performing woman. Even in his \u201cprivate\u201d life he is a kind of actor, one that performs the role of \u201cactor\u201d\u2014he must fulfill the expectations of a voyeuristic culture and engage in the decadence that his celebrity demands. In fact, his drunken fall down the stairs that occurs at <i>Somewhere</i>\u2019s start is in keeping with the debauchery that should characterize the life of a successful Hollywood star. This fall breaks his arm, making his symbolic castration a result of an objectifying gaze turned back upon its source.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a point at which Johnny, overcome by self-loathing, calls his ex-wife and cries. \u201cI\u2019m fucking nothing\u2014I\u2019m not even a person,\u201d he says. This is a subtle admission that his life has been a prolonged contrivance. The excess that surrounds him\u2014both the actual excess that arouses his bourgeois guilt (as presented by Richter\u2019s analysis) and the erotic excess that marks his personal life\u2014has overtaken and defined him. His pathetic relationships with women hint at a greater disappointment. They are characteristic of a true depressive, someone whose inability to understand or respect others stems from a deep-seated discomfort with his own identity. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Johnny\u2019s sunset walk at the end is in keeping with this performance. Even after both he and Cleo weep and confront their dysfunction, his only recourse is to live one of Hollywood\u2019s hackneyed roles: that of the contemplative protagonist severing his connections to the world of luxury and pleasure in order to <i>really think about his life</i>. But this contemplation, this anguish\u2014is this yet another example of him squirming under the watchful eyes of a prying public, another character he feels compelled to act? Coppola\u2019s cynical nod to the cinematic tradition, then, reveals that performance does more than arouse; it deceives. Try as he might, Johnny cannot escape the strictures that have marked his life thus far. Even his symbolic rejection of his mediocre past amounts to nothing more than a tragically empty gesture, a simple alteration to the script. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p> ",

Today, to give the lie to has been subsumed by its derivatives, \u201cto belie\u201d or \u201cto prove to be false.\u201d If heard at all now, the phrase is usually devoid of human agents: evidence gives the lie to claims; new studies give the lie to former scientific beliefs. To <i>call out on</i> (or, basically, to rebuke) performs a more generalized and colloquial function in our language. To call (someone) a liar is rarely done outright\u2014normally in the second person interrogative, \u201cAre you calling me a liar?\u201d\u2014and then only in a mode of disbelief and negative suggestion. With the decline of giving the lie, the artistry and etiquette of lying\u2014conjoined to its complement, the ritual of giving someone (back) the lie\u2014have fallen into the obscure territory of the unnamed.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may be symptomatic of modern and increasingly moderated times. As the OED specifies, giving the lie is always performative, a kind of gauntlet-throwing, a moment of making-official. One cannot give the lie over the phone, in an email, on Blogger or via Gchat; and then again, possibly through Skype; like a handshake or a vow, giving the lie requires the formality of (sort of) physical human presence: <i>to his face</i>. And whereas lying may lie dormant during a long incubation period, with telling and receiving separated by many minutes or years, <i>giving</i> the lie occurs only in the singularity of the speech act itself. Or, as William Faulkner wrote in <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i>, the giving of the lie might instantly ricochet off of the lie itself: \u201cpercussion and repercussion like a thunderclap and its echo and as close; the statement and the giving of the lie, the decision instantaneous and irrevocable.\u201d   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This notion of the irrevocable may also be outmoded, as we endlessly revise and rehearse our messages, with so much anxiety and yet, finally, with so little finality. Our communications seem predicated on their very <a href=\"http://hypocritereader.com/6/open-ends\">open-endedness</a>; with the ever imminent possibility to \u201csend\u201d to an <i>illimitable</i> number of recipients, there is no respect to time, or material cost (there is none of either); and our face-to-face meetings, when they are personal, have less pressure for resolution or closure. (<i>I\u2019ll call you later.</i>)  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cGiving the lie,\u201d with its old-fashioned air (apparent even when Faulkner uses it in 1936; even when his speakers speak it in 1910), is a vestigial holdover from ancient speech practices and codes. Tracing the idiom to its origins in the 16<sup>th</sup> century taps into a moment of fracture in the process and politics of speaking and signifying; we can see that in its earliest uses, <i>to give the lie</i> may have had little or nothing to do with lies or fact-checking, and much more to do with sovereignty and the Word. As Richard Bancroft wrote in 1593, in his anti-Reformist tract defending the bishops and monarch,   </p>\r\n\r\n<p><blockquote>[\u2026] [T]he <i>Queen Regent</i> made a Proclamation of her De\u017fire of Peace, and that the State of the Realm might at the la\u017ft be quiet : But they confuted it: And did animate tho\u017fe of their Faction (with all their Might) to be always ready, and to \u017ftand upon their guard. They gave the Queen the Lye divers times, and u\u017fed her with mo\u017ft de\u017fpiteful Speeches. And at the Length they came to that Boldne\u017fs, as that they termed the Queen\u2019s Part a Faction: And renouncing their Obedience unto her, prote\u017fted, that who\u017foever \u017fhould take her Part, \u017fhould be puni\u017fhed as Traitors, when\u017foever God \u017fhould put the Sword of Ju\u017ftice into their Hands.</blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, giving the lie seems to represent a more generalized impertinence or insubordination. Giving the lie\u2014perhaps here, already, used almost figuratively; are they even speaking directly to the Queen herself? (and to her face?)\u2014is an assault upon the autonomy of another speaker, on the near divine providence of another person to make meaningful speech. Presumably the Reformists do not literally give the Queen the lie, in that they do not call her, to her face, a liar; giving the lie, as employed in Bancroft\u2019s text, seems rather to epitomize \u201cde\u017fpiteful Speech,\u201d speech used not merely to converse or convey information but to degrade another speaker, disrupting a former status quo by elevating oneself above her. Assaulting the Queen\u2019s absolute authority\u2014not to tell the truth, but <i>to be believed</i> unquestioningly and automatically, and so obeyed with no spacing between the giving and the execution of the <i>Do as I say</i>\u2014and staging their assault via speech acts that \u201cuse,\u201d \u201cterm,\u201d \u201crenounce,\u201d and \u201cprotest,\u201d the Reformists prompt the formation of a radical, new kind of insult, one that fundamentally subverts another\u2019s ability to participate in the very signifying economy by which she might answer back or redeem her reputation and authority to do things with words. Hence the urgency introduced by giving the lie: unless rectified, immediately, the act has the power (like saying <i>Jinx!</i>) to eliminate a speaker, casting him from society in a state of disgrace that can only ensue from the special impotence of speechlessness. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irrevocably changing the relationship between the giver and receiver, giving the lie seems also to implicate a public. In giving the Queen \u201c<i>the Lye</i>,\u201d the Reformists assault the Queen\u2019s authority to govern not only them but also all of her other subjects. As private and personal as giving the lie may have become by the 20<sup>th</sup> century, it remains intrinsically linked to influence, publics, and performance. To publicly and \u201cBold\u201dly renounce one\u2019s loyalty to one\u2019s sovereign lingers as giving the lie\u2019s inherent transgression. Irrespective of the presence or absence of witnesses, and though the threat of making one\u2019s accusation public may remain theoretical or wholly absent when giving the lie, answering to it always reinscribes the possibility of a fundamentally public disgrace as the underlying stake, as though to succumb to the insult just once\u2014like, say, losing one\u2019s virginity\u2014were enough to permanently and symbolically ruin all future prospects of claiming one\u2019s former social space.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notice Bancroft\u2019s outrage that the factious Reformists, in giving the Queen \u201cthe lye,\u201d perform a remarkable inversion, promising that those who obey the Queen will \u201c<i>be puni</i><i>\u017f</i><i>hed </i>as Traitors\u201d; further, by claiming \u201cthe <i>Queen</i>\u2019s Part <i> a Faction</i>\u201d they instate themselves as the hegemonic majority\u2014which, as we all know, is the part that generally officiates over the threshing of the truth from the lies. The potency and combativeness of giving the lie, inasmuch as we might consider it an affront to sovereignty, begins, at its historical foundation, as a challenge to the sovereign ruler herself. The giving of the lie then does not necessarily refer to a (particular) lie\u2014rather, <i>the</i> lie that one gives refers always to the same performative giving, the reiteration or citation of the practice of insubordination. Joseph Addison, writing in 1711, seems to concur with Bancroft and with late 20<sup>th</sup>-century China that to give the lie is an insult so grave in and of itself that it forecloses any analysis of the accusation, the purported lie itself:   </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The great Violation of the Point of Honour from Man to Man, is giving the Lie. One may tell another he Whores, Drinks, Blasphemes, and it may pass unresented; but to say he Lies, tho' but in Jest, is an Affront that nothing but Blood can expiate.   </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Though a touch facetious, and basing his intellectual authority on medieval chivalric codes that establish Courage as the greatest \u201cPoint of Honour\u201d in men (and Chastity, of course, in women), Addison nevertheless reinforces the solemnity of giving the lie; it seems only moments, and degrees of tightly-wound self-restraint, removed from the even more ritualized and definitive confrontation of dueling. (Sir Walter Raleigh goes so far as to observe that, conventionally, \u201c[\u2026] to give the lie/ Deserves no less than stabbing.\u201d) As Addison explains,   </p>\r\n\r\n<p><blockquote>The Reason perhaps may be, because no other Vice implies a want of Courage so much as the making of a Lie; and therefore telling a man he Lies, is <b>touching him in the most sensible Part</b> of Honour, and indirectly calling him a Coward. I cannot omit under this Head what <i>Herodotus</i> tells us of the ancient <i> Persians</i>, That from the Age of five Years to twenty they instruct their Sons only in three things, to manage the Horse, to make use of the Bow, and to speak Truth. [emphasis added]</blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for the purposes of this essay, Addison is invaluable for introducing the notion of the <i>touch</i> that occurs in giving the lie. Much like the handshake alluded to earlier, or the slap, or the stab, the giving of the lie occurs 1.) once; 2.) in time; and 3.) unmistakably. Intimately violent, the giving of the lie temporarily and temporaneously closes distance between two persons, allowing a direct (and so absolutely unequivocal) transfer of information. There is no possibility of misinterpreting a giving of the lie, or of revoking it once it is given; like a touch, it impels two distinct organisms to experience and process, simultaneously, the same information, the same set of shared sensory and symbolic data. Two animals, however briefly, cease to be discrete, closed systems. The giving of the lie disrupts normally sacrosanct separations. And perhaps even more so than the information transferred via touch, the exchanges that occur in the giving of the lie are specifically codified and inscripted, with preordained reactions and consequences. However briefly (thunderclap\u2014echo), the narratives of two lives synchronize, passing through the same point.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is unsurprising then that absent from the texts above is any mention of the lies themselves\u2014in Faulkner\u2019s novel, importantly, the purported lie isn\u2019t one\u2014or the question of when and how giving the lie may be warranted. Today we love giving the lie (although we wouldn\u2019t call it that), giving it lightly and loudly; whistleblowers, though their accusations may have more to do with \u201cexposing the truth\u201d than with \u201cgiving the lie,\u201d are our champions, and calling someone a liar pales in comparison to the offense of telling her she \u201cWhores, Drinks, Blasphemes\u201d (although we love these accusations too\u2014they are the great democratic levelers, felling our loftiest politicians and pop stars and lowliest local news lowlifes alike). Yet this penchant is not historically unique; in the essay whose title (in its English translation) is borrowed for this one, Montaigne meditates on why we get so especially riled up over being \u201cgiven the lie\u201d when it is so banal. Describing his contemporary France, with its vogue for lying, he writes in 1580,  </p>\r\n\r\n<p><blockquote>Men form and fashion themselves to it as being an honourable practice; for dissimulation is among the most renowned qualities of this age. Consequently, I have often considered whence could arise this habit, which we retained so religiously, of feeling ourselves more bitterly injured by being charged with this vice, which is so common with us, than with any other [\u2026]</blockquote>  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Montaigne\u2019s attentiveness to the practice of lying, his concern with the \u201cvice,\u201d reveals even to the novice francophone that we are lost in translation; Montaigne never wrote about \u201cgiving the lie.\u201d \u201c<i>Du d\u00e9mentir</i>,\u201d the essay\u2019s original title, translates more literally as \u201con refutation.\u201d Despite the plethora of phrasal verbs involving the French \u201cto give\u201d (donner), and notwithstanding Derrida\u2019s obsession with the gift, the French have no equivalent to the English idiom.)   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Robert Pinsky put it, writing about today, but as an introduction to Raleigh\u2019s invocation to \u201cgive the world the lye,\u201d  </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Denunciation abounds, in its many forms: snark (was that word invented or fostered in a poem, Lewis Carroll\u2019s \"The Hunting of the Snark\"?), ranking-out, calling-out, bringing-down, blowing-up, flaming, scorching, trashing, negative campaigning, skepticism, exposure, nailing, shafting, finishing, diminishing, down-blogging. Aggressive moral denunciation\u2014performed with varying degrees of justice and skill in life, in print, on the Web, in politics, on television and radio, in book-reviewing, in sports, in courtrooms and committee meetings\u2014generates dismay and glee in its audience.  </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>The very proliferation of synonyms seems reflective of why our modern, much-mediated moments of denunciation bear little relation to giving the lie, with its definite article, its unmistakable gravity, its singular irreplicability and irreversibility, its irony-foreclosing seriousness: <i>to say he Lies</i>, tho' but in Jest, <i>is an Affront that nothing but Blood can expiate</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, with the expression\u2019s archaism and unfamiliarity\u2014and its strange disjuncture with its more common uses (as \u201cto belie\u201d)\u2014it conjures an oddly literal transaction. <i>Here is your lie; I see what it is, and no longer want it; take it.</i> Yet what one is <i>giving</i> in giving (someone) the lie is not a lie at all; we might ask what, if anything, is given? And <i>how</i> is the giving being given? Obscurely, <i>to give</i> may mean to attribute (as in the phrase, \u201cThe translation of the <i>Diatribe</i> against England, which has been given to the pen of M. de Tallyrand\u201d); to give you the lie, then, means to ascribe\u2014<i>to you</i>\u2014the lie that was told, to accredit your authorship or ownership of the lie. Presupposed here is that the lie is already known for what it is; it is out; it is no longer fooling anyone: it is simply waiting to be returned to its creator in order to definitively conclude its circulation.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet giving the lie attributes not only the lie to the liar, it also attributes the lie <i>qua</i> lie: in the giving of the lie, \u201cthe lie\u201d is what reveals itself to be one. The lie has no natural existence of its own; it does not lurk in minds or mines waiting to be unearthed. Notwithstanding good and bad information, true and false belief, knowledge and ignorance. But \u201cgiving the lie\u201d implies that a lie is not, or does not <i>exist</i>\u2014it <i>happens</i>. Giving the lie suggests that rather than absolute, lies are relational, contingent, and occasional: flashpoints, like Faulkner\u2019s thunderclap, of an indelible and instantaneous meeting of two people on equal terms\u2014however volatile or unstable that instant of equalizing. Somewhat anachronistically, we might then speak of the intimacy of giving the lie.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Faulkner\u2019s <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> \u201cgiving the lie,\u201d employed by two of the novel\u2019s several narrators, refers exclusively to the moment between father and son, when a lie is not told but rather a truth denied and also definitively refused by the son\u2019s giving the father the lie.   </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Because Henry loved Bon. He repudiated blood birthright and material security for his sake \u2026 So much so that he (Henry) could give his father the lie about a statement which he must have realised that his father could not and would not have made without foundation and proof. Yet he did it, Henry himself striking the blow with his own hand, even though he must have known that what his father told him \u2026 was true. He must have told himself \u2026 <i>I will believe; I will. I will.</i> [\u2026]</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Evoked again in terms of physical contact (striking the blow), here giving the lie impels the physical presence not only of the face, but the hand to strike, the body to receive the blow. In giving his father the lie, in repudiating kinship (\u201cformally abjur[ing] his home and birthright\u201d), Henry disowns his father Sutpen, and his inheritance; the novel is unequivocal that this is only just and inevitable and natural consequence. Yet the deferral of answering for the giving of the lie\u2014the web of other persons and repudiations that must coalesce before not Henry but Bon and Sutpen die for the giving of the lie\u2014implies a more complex economy of giving the lie, a familial and class and national genealogy predating Henry\u2019s (or even Sutpen\u2019s) lifetime.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interiority projected onto Henry by his narrators also implies a privacy in giving the lie that predates and predicts the violent and intimate collision of two persons in one giving the other the lie. Publicizing his (volitional) belief, he simultaneously cements it in the privacy of his own mind. Importantly, the narrators who attribute Henry\u2019s act as \u201cgiving the lie\u201d are commentating at a half century\u2019s remove. As Mr. Compson explains, driving the novel\u2019s self-consciousness nearly to explosion, \u201cperforming their acts of simple passion and simple violence, impervious to time and inexplicable,\u201d these characters are all larger than life,   </p>\r\n\r\n<p><blockquote>simpler and therefore, integer for integer larger, more heroic and the figures therefore more heroic too, not dwarfed and involved but distinct, uncomplex who had the gift of loving once or dying once instead of being diffused and scattered creatures drawn blindly limb from limb from a grab bag and assembled, author and victim too of a thousand homicides and a thousand copulations and divorcements.</blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other words they, purposive, focused, coherent (despite the fact that we in our clumsy attempts at reconstruction might render them incoherent), could give the lie\u2014whereas already, in 1911, another modernity, an act of such singularity and decidedness was no longer possible. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>On January 19, 1951, Kim Philby, then chief British intelligence agent in the United States, was hosting a dinner party for his colleagues. Among his guests was a couple new to their set: former FBI man William King Harvey and his wife Libby. Both of them were drunk, as were most of the other guests, many of whom bore secret information, and many of whom were emotionally unstable (for some, this condition was brought on by the secrets they had borne, while for others it was apparently congenital). The general mood then was that of dread before some disaster. Causing particular unease was Guy Burgess, second secretary of the British embassy, whom Harvey loathed at first sight and who seemed almost invented to typify everything Harvey was not. Burgess, notorious for his conquests of younger men, for his social climbing, and for his great wit, won his degree at Cambridge where he had been a member of its secret debate society, the Apostles. Harvey, notorious for his taciturnity, for his in-office collections of guns and knives, and for twiddling these guns and sharpening these knives while his colleagues attempted to talk to him, won his degree at Indiana University and had been a member of the Robert King Construction Company. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally a row broke out. Libby had volunteered to have her likeness done by Burgess, who was well known for his skill as a caricaturist.  Burgess then dashed off a sketch of a dowdy woman with her skirt hiked up and her legs spread wide. Harvey took a swing at Burgess but missed and was restrained. The party was soon over.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bill Harvey\u2019s career was marked by many great failures, but there could have been none more regrettable than his inability to land a punch on Burgess. Among all the things Burgess possessed that Harvey did not was a commission from Stalin. Three months after Philby's dinner party Burgess boarded a cruiser to Brittany and fled from there to the USSR. The Soviet spy ring of which he was a member came to be known as the Cambridge Five. Kim Philby, the party's host, was its most successful agent. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like any good group of heroes or villains, each Cambridge Five member comes with his own immediately recognizable attributes. Kim Philby was the perfect spy: brilliant, conscientious, unflappable, and charming. He ran MI6 before they discovered he was on the wrong team, and his many feats included that of finding his own code name listed on an intercepted cable and personally delaying investigation of the matter until he could have his Soviet informer murdered. Don Maclean, angry, alcoholic, Scottish and sexually confused, became about as successful a spy as Philby before he suffered a prolonged nervous breakdown in Cairo. Anthony Blunt, a priggish academic, sustained a long career as an art historian and was Surveyor of the King's Pictures for nearly thirty years before Margaret Thatcher finally exposed him (his knighthood was then revoked). The participation of John Cairncross, the ring\u2019s fifth member, was revealed only in the \u201890s and remains mysterious. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>But none of these characters enchants like Guy Francis de Moncy Burgess. Son of a Navy man, he would later explain his homosexuality by saying that he had watched his father die while having sex with his mother. He drove a Bugatti around Cambridge and would try to pick up young men with quips like \u201cI'd love to beat you, I'm sure you'd enjoy it.\u201d He was a controversialist and playboy and a pain in the ass before he was a Communist, but his greatest success was that he continued to be all three of these things even as a spy\u2014for above all else, Burgess was always a brilliant liar. \r\nBurgess\u2019s entrance into the world of Soviet intelligence might be taken as symbolic of his career in general. According to Miranda Carter\u2019s biography of Blunt, Soviet agent Aleksandr Orlov, who led the recruitment process at Cambridge, \u201cthought Burgess should be sounded out, particularly because he believed his homosexual contacts might be useful\u2014he was convinced that all upper-class Englishmen were homosexual. He reported to Moscow that \u2018the majority of this country's most polished sons are pederasts\u2019.\u201d In late 1934, Kim Philby, already accepted by the KGB, did not think Burgess could be a good spy, but according to his memoirs realized Burgess \u201chad convinced himself\u2026that he was being excluded from something esoteric and exciting. So he started to badger us, and nobody could badger more effectively than Burgess\u2026[Philby\u2019s Soviet contacts] became increasingly worried that, if he got nowhere, he might try some trick\u2014perhaps talk about us to people outside our circle. He might be more dangerous outside than inside. So the decision was made to recruit him.\u201d Burgess found his way to the Soviets as a social climber and, as it turned out, was valuable to them primarily as a socialite.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult to say precisely how much Burgess was able to aid Stalin, but it is agreed that his contributions to Soviet counterintelligence were a tier below those of Maclean and Philby. Still, only a few years out of Cambridge he became an assistant to Conservative MP and member of the Nazi-sympathizing Anglo-German fellowship Jack MacNamara, whom he was soon escorting on sex-themed trips through Germany (MacNamara was also gay). Then in 1938 he infiltrated British intelligence and entered MI6. He became a trusted friend of Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hector McNeil, who was effectively the cabinet's liaison to British intelligence. The two went on drinking binges together and enjoyed the London nightlife. According to Russian intelligence archives, he supplied 4,593 documents to the NKVD between 1941 and 1945 and was able to provide invaluable secret cables about Anglo-American plans for partitioning post-Nazi Germany. All the while he continued to play the hellion. According to Verne Newton, an American scholar of the Cambridge Five, \u201c[h]e was drinking whisky throughout the day from a flask in his desk, ate cloves of raw garlic as if they were slices of an apple, was perpetually disheveled, freely passed around pictures of his various youthful conquests, and boasted of urinating on a statue in front of the Buckingham palace.\u201d </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burgess was finally censured for his behavior in London. Afterwards, instead of being fired, he was dispatched to Washington, DC, a decision which makes no sense whatever to anyone and remains basically unexplained. He had always hated America from afar and liked it no better after experiencing it directly. Burgess seldom remained in the nation's capital and spent about as much time socializing in New York as he did working. His exact function at the Embassy in DC is unknown, though he probably did not do as much damage in the States as he had done in London. In fact, he may have impaired the Soviets more than the Americans. When he escaped with fellow spy Don Maclean, it became inevitable that Kim Philby, the Cambridge Five's linchpin, would be discovered. Although it cannot be said for sure whether Burgess's egress was a flight of fancy or Soviet-ordered, Philby never forgave Burgess and did not visit him in Moscow. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reading through the available source material, one can find many conflicting accounts of Burgess's general capacities as a spy and even more conflicting accounts about the events he was involved in. In recent publications, discrepancies between sources still tend to bear vestiges of US versus USSR propaganda, which is curious given that the Cold War has ended. \r\nThe story of a business trip Burgess took to the Citadel Military Academy in Charleston, SC, about a month after the dinner party at Philby\u2019s, serves as a particularly good example. On his way from DC, Burgess\u2019s Lincoln was pulled over three times for speeding; the third time the man behind the wheel was a drifter named James Turck, who was either a vagabond Burgess found hitchhiking or a lover Burgess had taken for a Southern romp\u2014depending on whom you believe. The first two times the car was stopped Burgess had been driving and had made use of his diplomatic immunity. But this excuse did not hold with a strange man behind the wheel, though Burgess did try to assert that, as a diplomat's \u201cchauffeur,\u201d Turck was also immune. Burgess's traveling partner was put in jail, and while Burgess left to get bail money (the local police force would not take a check) Turck was pressured into giving an affidavit. Word of the incident soon got back to DC. It was a great embarrassment for the agency and Burgess was let go and sent back to London. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to ex-Soviet sources, including Philby and Cambridge Five attach\u00e9 Yuri Modin, the incident was a clever Soviet plot to have Burgess sent back to London, where he could personally warn fellow spy Don Maclean of imminent danger. Newton, on the other hand, maintains that this is impossible, because it was Turck\u2019s affidavit, which Burgess could not have foreseen, that brought his misdeeds to light. Many other mysteries of this kind are chalked up to American ingenuity, Soviet ingenuity, American stupidity, or Soviet stupidity\u2014depending on the camp of the event's interpreter.   </p>\r\n\r\n<p>An especially puzzling question of this sort is why Burgess went with Maclean to Moscow at all. By all accounts he loved living in London and never meant to move. Many assume he was tricked by the Soviets he had aided for so many years, and was told he could return to Britain only to be denied the option later. When Burgess fled England for the USSR in 1951, W. H. Auden, who knew the man well, wrote: \u201cI know exactly why Burgess went to Moscow. It wasn't enough to be a queer and a drunk. He had to revolt still more, to break away from it all.\u201d </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more one becomes acquainted with Burgess\u2019s character, the less fanciful this idea seems. Maybe he never did want to <i>live</i> in the USSR, but it does not seem improbable that the desire to shock might have pushed him toward Moscow. If this were in fact the case, it would be a fitting end to his story\u2014a betrayal by a country for the sake of which he had betrayed his own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this does not explain what had made this pleasure-seeker desire to revolt in the first place. Tom Driberg, an MP and fellow socialist with admiration for Burgess, sums up his character thus (he is trying to justify Burgess's lifelong devotion to the apparel of his aristocratic alma mater): \u201cAs a socialist, Guy Burgess disapproves of the educational system of which Eton is a part. As an old Etonian, he has an enduring love for Eton as a place, and an admiration for its liberal education methods... He is one of the few Old Etonians who wear an Old Etonian bow-tie.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Burgess was never able to reconcile his prejudices \u201cas a socialist\u201d with his predilections as a person. And indeed even the most strongly held abstract beliefs are seldom a match for such concrete matters as bow ties. Any ideology comes equipped with a means to help its acolytes square their personal desires with the mandates of the group. Organized religion has given us the confessional and self-flagellation, among other techniques, while Soviet Marxism relied overwhelmingly on censorship of ideas and secret murder. In the case of the Soviets, these tactics succeeded for a good while in producing a nation free of public dissent. This is to say that for the Soviets, and for the purveyors of other state-mandated ideologies, the production of adept liars and self-deceivers is as valuable as any other labor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The situation becomes all the more precarious for a man like Burgess, whose personal deviances from the Soviet line could be rationalized as \u201cgetting to know the enemy\u201d and dissimulation. And it was indeed difficult for American and British intelligence forces to believe that this drunk Cambridge lecher in his \u201cOld Etonian\u201d get-up was a friend of the Soviet cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, Burgess never wrote his memoirs, and for some years it seemed the Western world might never hear another word from him. On February 11, 1956, however, he and Don Maclean summoned a press conference in the National Hotel in Moscow to break their silence. Here is the beginning of their co-written statement, in its own astonishing argot: </p>\r\n\r\n<p> \u201cIt seems to us that doubts as to our whereabouts and speculation about our past actions may be a small but contributory factor that has been and may again be exploited by the opponents of Anglo-Soviet understanding . . . We both of us came to the Soviet Union to work for the aim of better understanding between the Soviet Union and the West, having both of us become convinced from official knowledge in our possession that neither the British nor, still more, the American Government was at that time seriously working for this aim.\u201d </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Afterward, they permitted no questions. However the aforementioned Tom Driberg soon wrote Burgess to ask for an interview. He responded almost immediately and with great enthusiasm: \u201cI look forward to hearing from you. Let me know if you get this letter... I should like to go round Moscow with an English socialist... Make any use of this letter you like...\u201d But his enthusiasm did not go unchecked: \u201cMy reason for not pressing the matter too hard, however, is that as I said in my \u2018Statement\u2019 the only thing I am interested in is (not my personal case but) Anglo-Soviet relations and their possible improvement.\u201d After this charming parenthetical Burgess repeats himself: \u201cas I say I am supporting but not insisting. Since there is doubt about the utility of personal controversy\u2026\u201d\u2014then only a few paragraphs later adds a postscript asking Driberg to clear up a rumor about his having been once expelled from an academy as a schoolboy for theft.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driberg's records of Burgess in Moscow are among the most fascinating Cambridge Five documents I've come across. It has been alternately suggested that Driberg was working for the KGB or for British intelligence when he met Burgess in the USSR, though a recent biography of the man has done much to dispel both claims. Driberg is obviously sympathetic to Burgess and resembles him more than a little. Like Burgess, he lived several lives at a time: he was a long-time member of the Communist party who eventually become a controversial MP. And he too was open about sexual matters: as Christopher Hitchens has put it, with characteristic delicacy, Driberg \u201cwould go anywhere and do anything for the chance to suck somebody off\u201d\u2014a habit deemed illegal by the branch of government for which he worked until 1967. In fact Driberg felt such a pull toward Burgess that, after his visit, he wrote a short biography of him called <i>Guy Burgess: A Portrait</i>, published in 1956, which he describes as a sort of apologia.  \r\nThe next-to-last chapter of the book concerns Burgess's time in Russia, and it is written in the form of a chummy dialogue. Toward the end of the piece, after Burgess has said that he speaks only \u201ckitchen Russian, enough to talk to my housekeeper at the <i>dacha</i>,\u201d Driberg asks him, \u201cBut on the whole you're happy here? I suppose you get a bit lonely sometimes?\u201d Burgess\u2019s answer to this question is the climax of a minor literary masterpiece, which vies with the best in Dostoevsky or Nabokov in terms of the unreliable narrator's linguistic sleights. It is reproduced here in full:  </p>\r\n\r\n<p><blockquote>\r\n<p>\u201cOf course I miss London and my friends there, and New York too. But I have become used to the ways of solitude, and on the whole I like it. I read an enormous lot\u2014I've read most of the Everyman library.  </p>\r\n<p>I lead a very quiet life: I try to get to my dacha most evenings\u2014it's less than 40 minutes' drive from the office.  </p>\r\n<p>In London my main expenditure was on drink and cigarettes. They're both cheap here. I always smoke these very cheap cigarettes\u2014Prima, they're called. The people at the office say I oughtn't to.  </p>\r\n<p>I drink only wine\u2014this Caucasian white wine, whenever I can get it. Hardly ever vodka, unless I'm sick. It's the best cure for an upset stomach.  </p>\r\n<p>I always refuse vodka at parties\u2014it's not easy. Somehow I don't usually need it.  </p>\r\n<p>You know, Tom, living in a Socialist country does have a therapeutic effect on one.  </p>\r\n<p>I know people at home will find this difficult to believe, but this is a tolerant country. As you know, I\u2019m an old-fashioned 19th-century dogmatic atheist, not an agnostic.   </p>\r\n<p>Oddly enough, it's only since living in Russia that I\u2019ve learned to respect those who believe in religion . . . or some of them.  </p>\r\n<p>Don't think I'm \u2018starry-eyed\u2019 about this place. I can't stand that attitude. Nor can they\u2014the Russians, I mean. I criticise things here, and they take criticism seriously.  </p>\r\n<p>As a matter of fact, they tell me I\u2019m lucky to be alive. At the time of that disgraceful business of the \u2018doctor's plot\u2019 I wrote a sharp note to Beria telling him he was wrong, and telling him why I knew he was wrong\u2014because I\u2019d had a lot of dealing in Washington with \u201cJOINT\u201d [the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee] and I knew they could not possibly have done what they were said to have done.  </p>\r\n<p>Fortunately, the friend whom I gave the letter to, asking him to see that Beria got it, was so terrified that he never passed it on. If he had I'd probably have been shot.  </p>\r\n<p>Nor am I a Russophil as such. Like Harold Nicolson, \u2018I have never been a victim of Slav charm.\u2019 Sometimes they are maddening, though I get on very well with my own colleagues.  </p>\r\n<p>But, despite all the things that are wrong\u2014honestly, I'm not trying to do propaganda\u2014it is a Socialist country, and there is a real kind of democracy developing, different from ours, but real. . . . And living in it is the feather-bed after the chaise-longue, you know.  </p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, yes, I am lonely. I'd like to have a good gossip with some old friends. But here I'm lonely for the unimportant things.  </p>\r\n<p>In London I was lonely for the important things\u2014I was lonely for Socialism.\u201d</p>\r\n</blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burgess\u2019s answer is smooth and charming, and at first glance little about it seems obviously duplicitous. But then, examined closely, a number of his claims appear convoluted, disingenuous, or outright false, beginning with the first sentence. It is almost too nice a touch that the series of great books Burgess chose to read in the U.S.S.R. was one printed for Everyman, that ubiquitous Soviet hero. Nor does Burgess mention just how few of these books would have been permitted to the Soviet Everyman in 1956. On the other hand Burgess's claim that his sole use of vodka is medicinal seems, if strange, plausible enough\u2014until Driberg casually mentions him \u201cordering a carafe of vodka\u201d with dinner in the next chapter. In any case, the soothing power of Russia's famous liquor allows Burgess the strange and crafty transition to one of the monologue\u2019s more striking sentences: \u201cYou know, Tom, living in a Socialist country really does have a therapeutic effect on one.\u201d  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Were one to intentionally phrase a proposition to make it sound false, he could hardly do better than this. Bookended by the chummy and phony \u201cYou know, Tom\u201d and the impersonal \u201ceffect <i>on one</i>,\u201d\u2014with a \u201creally does\u201d placed in the middle for good measure\u2014the sentence might incline even the heartiest Soviet-empathizer toward skepticism.  And it is at this point that Burgess's narration loses some of its coherence. The following few sentences have little to do with those that come before or after them, though colloquialisms like \u201coddly enough\u201d help them come off naturally.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burgess is certainly right that the Russians take criticism seriously; they take criticism so seriously, in fact, that they would have had Burgess murdered if they had actually received it. Perhaps this is one of the factors that makes Soviet Russia \u201cthe feather-bed after the chaise-longue\u201d\u2014a metaphor which sounds good until you realize it does not make sense. Was the problem with England the fact that one could only recline but not sleep for long periods of time? Is the USSR avian in some important way? Whatever the chaise longue represents, Burgess does admit he yearns for it now and then: \u201cSometimes, yes, I am lonely. I\u2019d like to have a good gossip with some old friends\u201d comes off as one of the monologue\u2019s more straightforward statements. But it cannot go unmodified by a final, climactic outburst of poetry. The sentence \u201cIn London I was lonely for the important things\u2014I was lonely for Socialism\u201d is an unforgettable one. But was it true? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Driberg, for one, could not doubt Burgess\u2019s credibility. In his book's final chapter he explains that though he personally would not advocate flight to Russia, Burgess's actions were beyond reproach. \u201cAs a Socialist,\u201d he writes, \u201cI take the view that, on the whole, one should go on working for Socialism by such means as are available in one's own country \u2014in Britain, specifically, through the Labour Party. But this is a matter on which opinions may differ; and having talked at length with Guy Burgess, and satisfied myself of the passionate sincerity of his convictions, I respect him for his courage in doing what he thought right.\u201d This all sounds fine until we get to the following sentence: \u201cNor do I believe that he was ever a Soviet agent.\u201d Driberg, for all his care and sympathy, has been duped along with the rest of them. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is unless Driberg\u2019s book was an elaborate propaganda campaign, in which case Driberg would himself have had to have been a Soviet spy. This makes <i>Guy Burgess: A Portrait</i> a special sort of literary work: it is either entirely fallacious or an intimate portrait of a man about whom the author actually knew nothing.   </p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n\r\n<p>Not only do lies tend to impress and please other people, they provide a private, special pleasure for the liar. This is a lame enough generality, but Guy Burgess lends it a memorable face (handsome, squarish, with waves of carefully coiffed hair atop it and insolent lips toward the bottom). No one could sustain a life as consistently duplicitous as Burgess\u2019s without deriving some pleasure from the very act of self-contradiction. Certain critics of the Cambridge Five have not been able to help drawing a line from homosexuality to espionage\u2014as though there were no heterosexual liars or livers of double lives, not to mention master spy Kim Philby. However, another aspect of Burgess' sexual life might not be irrelevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hitchens, in his London Review of Books piece on Tom Driberg which I quoted earlier, mentions that the men Driberg pursued were invariably \u201cheterosexual, proletarian, and\u2026unknown to Tom before the encounter,\u201d which Hitchens notes \u201ccan be a form of slumming\u2026\u201d Burgess's sexual habits were exactly similar, which is something that, for once, all sources agree on. To pick only one quotation, his Soviet ally Yuri Modin writes, apparently without any intended irony, that Burgess \u201cfound lovers in every social category. He had a strong preference for lorry drivers and working men, whom he habitually paid for sex. He liked their company and would cross-examine them mercilessly about how they were coping with the depression.\u201d One begins at this point to wonder whether Burgess's career with the NKVD/KGB wasn't one long, exhilarating spell of \u201cslumming it.\u201d He could enjoy the refined pleasures of his high-class peers, but he could also know that he had rebelled against them. As with the adventurer who yearns to bed <i>common people</i>, the role of the playboy was in his case simultaneously the role of the rebel and proletariat.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that, in the end, is how we might guess at his unhappiness in Moscow, even if we did not have the desperate letters to friends or his suicide by alcohol. There were no more double lives for Burgess to live. And, though there exists a picture of him wearing his \u201cOld Etonian\u201d bow tie beneath an astrakhan cap, one doubts the Soviets would have flinched much at this particular irony even had they recognized it. Transplanted to a country where a matter so outrageous as expressing one's opinion could summon the death penalty, Burgess had no one he could safely shock either. The idea is so dreary and sad one almost wishes Burgess had never fled, that he had died in flagrante\u2014pleasing a crowd of Old Boys with his wit, enthralled with his own deceit, rabid over his fast cars and conquests, but at the same time ever so lonely for socialism. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

Sometimes\u2026there\u2019s a man.\u201d And them Coen Brothers was right. Sometimes, there\u2019s a man. If Charlie Breadmaker knew I was writing this, well, he would first point a finger at his given pseudonym and dismiss it as \u201cthinly-veiled.\u201d Could-have-beens and Should-I-haves and Would-were-I\u2019s are then to enter into the equation, as they always do. Equations, being a part of math and art and also a part of life, enter into most things. Relationships between people tend to have to equal something, either in the present or past tense. Retrospectively, a relationship equation often does not equal, does not exist (math people, with their disdain for words and their love of symbology and abbreves, call this DNE).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does that render it a lie? A faulty equation? We are all scientists with failed hypotheses, we are all pimply unshowered math majors in love. The good thing about the retrospective of a life of broken equations is that they make for good non-fiction articles with thinly veiled and oft-pointed pseudonyms. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It all brings me here, to the great recounting of Charlie Breadmaker, a Cornhusker with a heart of Great Plainsy Gold. As a product of our great nation\u2019s middle-west, he often waged wars and hatched schemes to reclaim an identity neither western nor middle. He was a world traveler by age 4; in his early teens, he spoke fluent Japanese. On a spring break in Washington, DC, the spring break before I put 68 bobby pins in my Junior Prom hair, I met Charlie Breadmaker, and I thought he was a bit brutey and showoffish. I didn\u2019t know Japanese, and here was this blond boy pronouncing everything correctly at the Kyoto Bowl in the mall food court. I dared him to eat a whole chunk of wasabi paste out of spite. He did, and as expected, he turned beety and fell to the floor choking and almost died. A day later he nearly said he loved me, and there I was with a Golden Boy to almost call my very own. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thing is, my Junior Prom was not nowhere near Lincoln, Nebraska. I did not go to Lincoln East High. I had never seen the Great Plains or Carhenge. I was a product of another suburban suffixual \u2018west, that of the great prefixual South\u2019. The SW, The Ess Dub. The 480. I lived in Phoenix, Arizona. I grew up in an adobe hut and ate cactus and rattlesnake and roped gophers and put horseshoes on coyote steeds. And so Charlie and I contented to a love affair of phones and instant messaging, a love that knew no rules or consequence save for the wish that one west could one day merge with the other. We knew a tectonic plate shift was not to be, so we sufficed. Simple \u2018hi\u2019s and \u2018bye\u2019s and \u2018what are you doing now\u2019s and \u2018how do you feel about such and so\u2019s. Getting to know yous. After all, you can\u2019t get to know someone over six days in the nation\u2019s capital. You can\u2019t walk the grounds of the Lincoln Memorial, traipse along the National Mall, and stare at the Hope Diamond enough to achieve Knowin\u2019 Someone. Retrospectively and with great inner confidence, I know now that you cannot achieve Knowin\u2019 Someone after years or decades or centuries. Often enough, you cannot know yourself.  But I knew him then. I knew him when. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We contented to this knewing over the years. While I front-burnered many real-life relationship recipes through the ends of high school and the earlies of college, I held a torch to the back-burner, the idyllic Breadmaker stew. It bubbled and simmered and kept me hungry. I moved to New York and he moved to S\u00e3o Paolo. I went to Phoenix for the summer and he moved back to the Plains. And then, one day, we found ourselves single in our respective situations. I decided to drive to Nebraska, and we would then escape to London.</p> \r\n\r\n<p>So many years of dormant, back-burner inactivity rendered me ineffectual in my front-burnering of Charlie Breadmaker. The act of togethering with someone who had for so long been together-apart, a part of me and yet apart of me, was more difficult than I expected. I had rubbery road trip legs. I lumbered out the car, ready to experience things that were not flat as the carview had been. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cHey.\u201d </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s grassy here.\u201d </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As lines go, this may not be a series of actual lines spoken. Dialogue changes as memory charges it, and who knows how memoirs fuel themselves with reality? Memory itself changes with our views from the day. In a dreamscape, in the then-present moment, my stomach turned on itself, the lines in the road kept me in a state of forward motion. I did not upchuck as I got off the Interstate and passed the Cornhusker Stadium, but did I want to? Probably. A, B, C, D\u2014all the alphabet streets ticked off, time got stranger, I got stranger and strangely close to my destiny. And then, when he was standing there and I was in a car, and when we went for fruit smoothies at the Juice Stop, and when we hung out by the pond near his backyard and I played with the cat, things were said. Ineffectual, but so effectual. Time was passing, togetherly. Dialogue happened, and I\u2019m sure I was nervous. Nervously, the saga of Charlie Breadmaker approached the forefront of my thinking, feeling, and being. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Front-burnering always makes me feel like swim team practice. What if I drown today? What if I didn\u2019t eat enough, or ate too soon before I got in the water? What if today is an 800 meter day? 800m/25m = 32 lengths of this non-Olympic sized pool, and that\u2019s without stopping. Could I shoulder that burden, could I protect myself? What races should I enter in the meet this Saturday? Breaststroke? Backstroke? Butterfly? Freestyle is a given, it\u2019s the easiest and swiftest stroke. But how should I challenge myself? If I\u2019m not challenged, is it working? If I am, am I failing? If I fail, if I get sixth place out of six, why do they give me a ribbon? A light green ribbon, a mark of shame. A blue. A red. That\u2019s what I want. Give it to me! God, make me faster! Make my arms longer, make my love thorough, make my wingspan outshine the length of my body! God, give me goggles that don\u2019t fill up with water, give me goggles with tighter straps! God, give me flipper feet and paddle hands! God, make me lithe, lean, make me a dolphin, give me anything other than what I\u2019ve got! </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charlie\u2019s sport was not swimming\u2014it was rugby. He did not balk at competitive non-drowning within the confines of disparately spaced water lanes. Rather, he embraced the breaking of his nose, the smashing-in of his face, the compaction of his vertebrae. He did not have time for worrying, or thinking. Where I second-guessed my hypotheses and wondered at the equations before me, he charged with refusal to calculate. And so our math began, jumbled from the very start. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We stepped in time through a wormhole in the middle of the middle-west, and we drifted nearly hand-in-hand toward London. We spotted it from where we slid, a small gray spot at the end of the line\u2014a kingdom united, a Britain, great. The slopes of the wormhole made me queasy, but we drank champagne to ease our troubled minds. When we emerged, the surrounding people spoke a more attractive English. Before us lay a m\u00e9lange of cobblestone walkways, Fleet Streets and Abbey Roads, a park and some palaces, feeding the birds for tuppence a bag, a Boy Who Wouldn\u2019t Grow Up, a large clock named Benjamin, a stone named Rosetta. Charlie, ever the textbook, informed me of why there are ravens all over the Tower of London. I cannot remember why, but I do remember that their wings were clipped. We ate Fish and Chips and drank good lagers. I was almost run over by several cars with oddly placed drivers\u2019 seats. My shoe got stuck in the Gap in the Tube and as I wiggled free I cursed my lack of Minding It. Several large Londoners held open the closing doors; Charlie Breadmaker looked on, laughing. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It was a friendly town. A town grayed by cobbles and cloudy sky. And throughout our journey, from Notting Hill to Camden Town, Charlie avoided the equation. Here he was, the rugby-warrior afraid to press the issue, and here I was, the failed porpoise, ready to dive into the Thames in the name of our unsolved mysteries. I looked through the wormhole and saw London as the answer rather than the prologue to our impending great question: Is this a love that works? Has it ever, will it ever? Will presents derive from pasts and integrate into futures? We stepped into our foreign circumstance as foreigners to each other. We were strangers who had always eclipsed great distance. And now? Perhaps distance is not in the longitudes and latitudes, but in the vessels that cross them. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>He pointed at the Rosetta Stone, there on its pedestal in the British Museum, an Egyptian fish-out-of-water, the word puzzle of the great scholars and thinkers. What were those Egyptians thinking? It\u2019s all here on the Stone, vaguely translatable into British English terms and vocabularic flavours! Charlie pointed at it with a gesture that said \u201cExactly. The foundation of our existence. The first languages. Do you see the markings? Those markings equated their meaning with existing objects in life. The signifier-signified. The written word at its earliest known form.\u201d I pointed at him with a gesture that said, \u201cI can\u2019t read it, and neither can you. And neither can we read each other.\u201d From that moment, I realized we were not speaking the same language; the answers we sought were not born of the same question. I looked to London for the Truth about Charlie Breadmaker. And all I found was a constructed alternate reality for something coded, something unknown. It was an escape from the stuff that makes us, that made us, and that would ever make us thereafter. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We returned to New York and Nebraska a little more confused. Later, I learned that there was a reason behind Charlie Breadmaker\u2019s avoidance of the great equation. He had, prior to our trip, fallen in love with another girl\u2014a girl in the middle-west who wore his jackets and attended his games and did all the things an absent southwestern New York Transplant couldn\u2019t do. She knew he went to London, but she didn\u2019t know my name.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe I was ready to ralph my traditional English Breakfast. Maybe. But I kept it in, O, I digested those beans on toast. I hunkered down, I carried the two and carried on with my life. Love is not the sum of hearts plus hands, but the product of the mind times the body, and that\u2019s at its easiest, most simply derived. It\u2019s a lot harder than that math; the hardest math is theoretical. Theory is a fancy word for guessing games, and Theorems are disproved time and time again. What is said on stone is debated for centuries. The world is flat until it is round, and people are the center of the universe until the universe revolves around the sun. And all becomes our collective past, all ceases to be. Eventually, the madness that defines us in time can be equated to DNE. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charlie moved back a burner or two, but we remained (and remain) steadfast friends with a serious language barrier. Somehow, sometimes, it\u2019s easier to talk about facts than past feelings. I continue with my calculations and my translations of numerical, symbolical equations into language I can more fully understand. I have oft wondered if Charlie\u2019s Golden, Wheat-Cropped Heart was left behind in Lincoln when we jumped through the wormhole. I have since decided that hearts stay with people, but minds wander.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rosetta Stone is a stone on which language is divided into three types of script. One is Ancient Greek, one is Egyptian Hieroglyph, and one is simply called \u201cdemotic.\u201d People like demotic the least because its name does not connote its origin. This is a drastic generalization on my part, but I like to know where things are from, because I think the place contributes largely to the formation of a person or notion steeped in culture or principle: Take Charlie Breadmaker, the Plainsian hunter and sometimes-man, with a vast expanse of a heart that runs wide over the emptiness and grabs at things it cannot hold. Take Jaclyn Backhaus, the desert mouse, a Lone Ranger with a heart that feeds on sunlight and survives on droughted water reserves. Take Mathematics, the universal language, the study of patterns and the oft-ill-fated testing of ways in which circumstances beget others. Take Love, the embittered source material for many poems, songs, and non-fiction articles with thinly-veiled pseudonymic antiheroes. And take London, just visible through that wormy escape-hatch, a grayed place across the sea where these things went once to meet. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>It is three thirty in the morning, ten days before Christmas. We've just finished shooting a huge Christmas party for the reality show I've been hired on for the day. I am eating a cookie for dinner after working thirteen hours and this is not my preference and I may be stuck here. I am probably stuck here, a two-hour drive away from where I live because other crew members took all the passenger cars home earlier in the evening and all that is left is a white van with two of the benches taken out so that we can stuff it full of equipment. The cookie has a novelty laser print on it in frosting: a photo of the host's massive abode. The cookie does not taste good, and as it becomes increasingly clear that the only way out of this place is to Tetris myself into the van between a light kit and the end of a c-stand, the prevailing feeling I have is that of astonishment. How did I get here, carrying half my body weight in sound equipment, chasing people I don't know around their house? What's the meaning of all of it, of filming the personal moments of people I would never meet outside of this job? Did anyone ever really believe in Santa Claus?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel it's entirely possible that the new docusoap forms of reality TV\u2014the high-drama, glamorous, lifestyle peek shows\u2014are born out of the same mentality as the story of Santa. In each, we are invited to believe something is real, even though logic suggests otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't directly remember a time when I believed in Santa. What I do remember is a period when I was certain about the physical falsehood of the jolly old elf but I continued talking and acting with my parents and friends as if he were real. I knew he wasn't real, and my parents probably knew I knew he wasn't real, but the point of the thing was to keep on pretending, to make the myth come to life by getting caught up in excitement and anticipation of magic. The viewer operates in a similar mentality when watching reality TV. Anyone raised in the media age knows that the mere presence of a camera crew makes the idea of true documentation suspect, but the audience ignores that nagging feeling because the notion that the fights and the tears could be real is just too tempting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there are two varieties of the reality show fantasy. On one side, the viewers get caught up in the scenes and the conflicts, constantly wondering what's real and what's not. What the audience may not realize is, on the other side, that the participants on the show are also involved in a truth debacle. Though some of the backstabbing gossip in reality show drama is started by the show's players, a nice dollop of negative comments originates with the producers. On a show I worked on last year, one character nearly got beaten up by another for something he was offhandedly coerced into saying about the other's girlfriend. Not only did producers invite the degrading comment in the first place, but they also were the ones who repeated the comment to the boyfriend, and the ones who told him where the offender was hanging out (i.e., where the cameras would be) a few days later, just in case he wanted to do something about it (which we suggested he indeed should). Participants are of course never told if or when production has orchestrated something but just like the audience, they too begin to question the bizarre coincidence of cameras rolling right when the action happens. They often beg, plead, or try to trick crew members into divulging the real truth. But the crew's continued employment depends on secrecy so we uphold the illusions and don't speak out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some reality performers are entirely aware of the artifice and are more than willing to simply spit out a line for the sake of story development. Others have more invested in the show and are more desirous for things to be real. There are times when the show character is more negative or more ridiculed than the original person, but there are also times when the character actually has it better off. The show can make characters seem like they have more friends than they really do. The production company can turn an aspiring musician's mediocre concert into a grand event by pulling strings to get a better venue. Thus, some participants believe in the show despite the times of negativity or manipulation because they want to believe they are their characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The producers and the participants on reality shows feed into a doppelganger world in which truth and fantasy combine. Someone on the show starts with an agenda, the others run with it, and in the end no one can say what is genuine. Even when I'm closest to the conversation, I can no longer figure out what is real and what is a lie. The distinction seems impossible and irrelevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are people who still believe entirely in reality TV. They believe the participants are never fed lines, never selectively edited, never asked to do something they wouldn't already do. My estimation is that despite what avid believers may say, truth isn't what we're after. The purpose, in fact, is to take things that exist and change them, heighten them, bring a taste of something beyond ordinary existence. So it seems reality TV is, like Santa, fanciful ideas presented as truth. Though this time we add joy in the misfortune of others as an agenda of the fantasy. There are many shows, of course, with varying themes. Some premises bring the viewer fantasies of success in business, adventure, or perfect relationships: not necessarily topics to cause the downfall of society. Yet regardless of thematic variety, there is still something unsettling about the genre. What disturbs me most about the current state of reality TV is not the potentially base or prurient aspects of viewership, but rather the idea that we are presenting a fantasy of a world just slightly different from our own. The fantasy is simply a world where people are a little more dramatic and a little less socially inhibited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if Santa is an okay thing for society, maybe reality TV isn't so bad. The characters on these shows might even achieve their dreams, form deep and trusting friendships, or gain insight into their true selves. They surely won't harbor grudges over ideas that have been planted in their heads about who did what to whom. The audience will find a moment of entertainment, or maybe even of inspiration. I will make it home to my warm bed and feel satisfied that I've helped to bring something good into the world. There will be rainbows and sunshine, and if we've been good Santa's helpers there will be a Christmas bonus. All you have to do is believe. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nThe easiest way to think of method, and perhaps the most obvious way, is as a technique or practice which allows the achievement of sure knowledge, of cogent argument, or of divine thinking. Method at first glance seems to be our thought\u2019s attempt at surety and concision when it participates in its highest ideological displays. As such, by method we are speaking of an idea which looks remarkably different in different cases: I suspect that Spinoza\u2019s counts, when he speaks of the geometric <i>order</i> which is nature\u2019s and by which nature is shown, and Gadamer\u2019s too, when he speaks of a coherent <i>openness</i> to tradition and understanding (a coherent openness I understand is called the \u2018hermeneutic experience\u2019). This purported surety and this diagnosed constancy serve to hide whatever heart a method may have. One too common way of refusing thought its best method is to consider method in tandem with some already understood prior characteristics it must have. Here, we do not begin with already understood characteristics of method, but rather with method\u2019s refusal to be bound to characteristics we already understand.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe instability of even the surest method displays itself in the method's constantly required defense; the method is enacted in some sequence of arguments, to be sure, and yet they are interspersed with questions that are to be finally answered with some obvious surety that the argument can go on. This obviousness is the obviousness of method, and allows us to be sure that the arguments can continue (in other words, for a little while longer, the method requires no more defense; the reader and the teacher have been brought to trust that they can continue thinking together). The method is unstable so far as every single time it begins to inform an argument, it is required to defend whatever transition occurred between even the closest of statements; the method is defended so long as it allows itself to be questioned, in the highest cases asking such questions of itself, especially those questions whose responses bring listeners and teachers back to method\u2019s obvious ability to continue.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe obliviousness of even the most prescient method displays itself in the method's needing to be written as both introduction and argument; the method may call itself logic, but we cannot find a hint of logic in any of the great introductions. We do well to recall our confusion whenever we begin reading an author, and how difficult it is to reread a work\u2019s introduction without continually recalling the path of the argument to follow, especially those works which challenge orthodox notions of methodology (not counting Nietzsche\u2019s prefaces, which are closer to obituaries for his prior texts). We search for a defense of such an introduction in vain: method proves itself in what transformation is enacted in the phenomena with which it deals, and if that transformation cows our perception and makes any but such a transformed understanding impossible, we acknowledge that yes, the prescience of method is defended. The obliviousness of method is the impossibility that a method knows a thing until it begins to know, until the arguments are written which touch on the closest of phenomena to our understanding. When an argument reaches the substance of the objects of our perception, when an argument states its conception of justice or the order of our political selves, when an argument defines what it is to breathe, and when we begin to breathe in its way and not our own - it is then that we are first able to understand the necessity of that method which previously defended itself by its appeal to logic. It is not that logic is invented when the argument finally reaches those close phenomena; rather, logic is first seen in the intercourse between those arguments and that introduction. Either alone is simply nonsense; the prescience of method is discovered when, flipping back to the introduction, we find it has always required whatever arguments happened to come.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe struggle between instability (out of which doubt) and obviousness happens while method is in the act of arguing. \u00a0The struggle between prescience and obliviousness is essential to method\u2019s achieving whatever topical scope is proper to the work in question. These two struggles may work to describe method\u2019s practice and technique. There is a third struggle, which concerns not simply method\u2019s practice and technique, but rather concerns the possibility that thought may be methodological at all, and so the possibility that thought may at times require moments without methodology, that thought may require periods of rest. This struggle is between method\u2019s deftness and the stalemate into which method sometimes enters.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe stalemate to which even the most deft of methodological thinkers comes cannot be avoided; it comes when anyone who thinks reflects on his teaching and its standpoint, at which point any method is avoided for some period of learning and reflection, a time when the thinker retreats into some activity prior to and informing method proper. A <i>full</i> discussion of teaching and reflection is neither topical nor possible when our concern is for method. Our topic is method; we will limit our discussion of teaching to a discussion of the teaching a thoughtful method may receive. In this spirit, we remark that all teachers who wrote, or writers who thought, paused between the books they wrote, and as often as not discovered some byway which made up the substance of their next book. We may go further and say that we suspect some thinkers of thoughts which lie, and thereafter their method becomes suspect (there will be more on this later; for now, I hope we agree that a suspect thinker, if he thinks, deserves all the more careful a reading). We can go so far as to acknowledge that a thinker, thinking only one thought, thinks through only one method no matter how many or few writings arrive bearing his name; yet this method can never be shown to continue with uninterrupted deftness so far as it relies on a bit of time for breathing again that prior mystery by which the thinker replenishes his thinking. At these times the method is in a stalemate, and no deftness or cunning will revive <i>its</i> thinking. Yet at times other than the stalemate it was only deftness which characterized the method, and especially deftness in application, deftness in the struggle between instability and obviousness, prescience and obliviousness; along the narrow paths of a great method, there is always the risk that the method may forget itself, devolve into trivialities and the untopical and the idolatrous. This risk gave method practice in the art of deftness; the consideration of this risk becomes so close to method\u2019s deftness that separating the two becomes impossible.\u00a0Method is closer to the risk that it may become trivial than it is to any success it may have, and when method comes ever closer to that risk, deftness becomes ever more the substance of whatever method is. All these abilities, its very deftness, the method has prepared for in the stalemate; yet its deftness is active and the furthest from stalemate, it is the narcotic and the high of war. To avoid stalemate or deftness is to avoid both; to avoid method at all is to resign oneself to courting whatever unworthy thought occurs when one is in repose; to avoid repose is to avoid the nourishment that allows thoughtful method to be deft when deftness is required. At the proper times method is required if thought is to maintain its precision and its love for the outside world; at the proper times method must be in stalemate and thinking must lie in repose for method to be nourished. That we see mystery in method\u2019s function and that we see opposition and contradiction in method\u2019s beginnings and ends is essential to the proper use of method. This proper use is neither constant nor consistent nor stable; this proper use is not knowledgeable nor technical nor practical. The proper use in method does not properly lie in any region where method is enacted; the propriety of method rests in the passage of thought from its consideration of method\u2019s stalemate towards an applied methodology.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe passage into method is not thought\u2019s only passage from repose into application. That this passage is not alone demands that we consider whether some thinker\u2019s thought may essentially lie; though perhaps the lie originates in some other passage thought takes to application, the passage of method to applied methodology may yet be intertwined with this lie. We take care to distinguish lies from errors: here, we are not speaking of errors, which persist even as a result of truthful thought, though at some degree of separation which mirrors the respective degrees of separation between thinking proper, the thoughtful passage of method\u2019s stalemate into applied methodology, and arguments themselves: errors are argumentative mistakes in calculating addition, whereas thought\u2019s lie may inhabit method\u2019s thoughtful passage as a lie which strengthens method\u2019s way of defining arithmetic. Can we speak of method\u2019s passage from stalemate (considered by thought in repose), to application (out of which any error may arise without touching method\u2019s truthfulness or lack thereof), and speak as if method has already been taught by some lie of thinking? \u00a0We remain unsure how a method shows itself and we remain unsure by whose eyes a method may be recognized; though a method may require lies in its technique, its practice, or its performance, we must remain unsure that lies actually contribute to the heart of method.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCan it be, then, that to begin with both lies and method is to avoid method in the first place? Is it the case that to begin with any stable idea and couple it to method can only interrogate the particulars of method\u2019s function rather than its essence, which is the passage of thought from stalemate to application? Does a beginning which supposes that we know any characteristic of a method without already having passed into method\u2019s application devolve into a basically falsifying beginning, one which resigns us to an interrogation only of written arguments and never of method in its fullness? We are unsure of method, of its basic characteristics. Our unsurety lies in method's intransigence against our interrogation with respect to instability or obviousness, obliviousness or prescience, deftness or stalemate. An interrogation which begins with any of these qualities and method sometimes slips into an analysis of some other quality and method, and sometimes slips into an analysis ignorant of method at all. We are unsure of method precisely because method itself interrogates these qualities; to begin with any one of them as if it is essential to method without allowing method\u2019s passage to take its own way invites method to cast doubt on any but its very own arguments, questions, introductions, and transformations. When we disallow method from doubting itself, we disallow ourselves from seeing the fullness of method; when we suppose that to interrogate method can begin with the surety that it has essential characteristics, we disallow method from doubting itself and its own essence. Method can show these qualities and characteristics quite well, but only under the guiding hand of some thinker whose method it is. An example of one such quality, prescience, which we must not at the outset couple to method but which has its place in the interrogation of method, will serve to \u00a0make a similar argument about beginning by coupling method to any sure characteristics. To begin here with say, 'prescience and method' will not end with either prescience or method given its due; they will only come together after some essential transformation of closer phenomena has taken place in the reader, by means of which method allows prescience to take its place among the closer phenomena already analyzed. In this way prescience is like truth, which depends for its close relationship with method upon the intricacies of analysis method has already performed on, say, the poetry of a text, the gestures of a human, or the rhetoric of a god. To begin with truth and method, we suspect, is to forgo all of oneself that loves reading, humanity, and the divine, and has developed itself on the basis of the precision and attention to the smallest of details that characterizes such love. Far from being sure at the outset that any phenomenon is essential to method, we must allow method\u2019s passage to bring up its essential characteristics of its own accord. Perhaps we can honestly say: we have to take care to start simply and with the small.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLies may very well be different, and another warning may be necessary. Again, though this next paragraph concerns applied methodology, it does not concern the results of such application, namely arguments. Therefore we are still not speaking of errors, but rather, for example, of the way in which disparate methodological rules are applied in a way which either <i>may not be</i> incoherent or <i>may be suspected of</i> incoherence. There remain degrees of separation between 1) thinking, and 2) method\u2019s thoughtful passage from stalemate to deft application, a thoughtfulness which includes essentially all three notions of passage, stalemate, and application, and 3) arguments, which are allowed to err or not regardless of some lie in method\u2019s passage. We are concerned with method\u2019s thoughtful passage, and we do not therefore say that if a method begins to lie method is thereby robbed of its basic instability. Not only does the slightest accusation of a lie drive method into the questioning stance which pauses all arguments for the sake of finding some supporting stance (this occurs especially when the method accuses itself, from itself); moreover, lying is at the heart of this questioning stance. Method must sometimes lie in order to properly frame an incisive questioning of itself. Neither imprecision nor naivete will suffice to phrase method\u2019s periodic doubt of itself in the most incisive way; method must speak and then begin to believe the most bald-faced lies simply to trust again that from the deepest depths in which method seemingly is concerned with <i>only</i> the irrelevant, it can rise again to a noble buttressing of the passage at hand. We do not mean, when we say this, to accuse method of thereby participating in some ignoble behavior, however, as the method does not trust that it is lying; its own suspicion of itself and the transformation of that suspicion into a basic tenet in which it trusts is such that all trust in the superfluousness of any questioning stance, though such trust remains, will not on its own support the continuation of argument. Lying is at the heart of such instability as blood is at the heart of the body; it is by the flow of lies into and out of instability that method knows to speed itself towards questioning or slow itself into the argument; without the lie instability may twitch and spasm, but method has stopped beating, and will never come to question itself or begin to come to its defense.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTherefore, neither do we say that lies rob method of the defense it undertakes when unstable questioning has begun; on the contrary, not only do lies leave the instability intact which demands the method's questioning, lies are the only means against which that defense can take place. The method asks: and is this a lie? and am I a lie?, and is answered with either the demand for continued defense or some trust that the argument can continue. Lies are that against which the defense tests itself and so that against which method strengthens itself; just as it becomes difficult to distinguish between an enemy and a friend in the highest conflicts, so does it become difficult to tell whether lies demand defense or defense demands the lie. Either way, the incitement towards the questioning and the questioning itself that method may undergo demands, at the beginning and through the end, that the lie continue to be the most believable, continue to be the most trustworthy, continue to be the most accusatory, so that when method finally defends itself and we finally find ourselves again affirming the obviousness of method, it can be sure no lie has escaped to find a home in that obviousness. Then we say that even such obviousness has some relationship with lies, if only that it is built upon that long, questioning defense which requires the lie, and that it is again confronted with the instability whose blood is the lie.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCould a method be oblivious without the lie? Could a method introduce itself without already knowing the shape of some phenomena to be discussed, artlessly claim that some analysis must take place before these phenomena are ever understood, without the employment by some thinker of the very basic lie that he has not already thought through the entirety of his work? Could a method be prescient without the lie? Could a method and its arguments be so intertwined, without a crack in the edifice, if the thinker did not steel himself on the lie that he will continue as a whole man through the grime and chaos and frustration which follows every word, every sentence, every paragraph put to paper? In response to these questions I ask the reader to remember that Thrasymachus blushed and was broken within the first ten pages of the <i>Republic</i> and yet continued in various forms until he became the very face of a tyrant, and Socrates wondered, continuously and fully and perplexingly, and nevertheless lived only a single life. \u00a0I ask the reader to wonder at the singularity of a life like Socrates, full of the most disparate questions yet always asked in one voice and with one face, and to wonder if such a life is possible without being born of the lie that Socrates will die as Socrates and as no one else. \u00a0How could he have known?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nStalemate and deftness: here is where we have to say that we cannot begin with \u201clies and method\u201d: not because to affirm that lies are essential to method robs method of qualities which we suspect method has, but because to affirm that lies are essential to method attributes to method qualities which disallow method from coming to a stalemate or coming to deftness. Would it matter whether such an affirmation robbed method of these qualities or not? We cannot say lies and method not because we must allow method to partake of stalemate and deftness, but because we disallow ourselves from giving too short shrift to that strengthening mystery which may or may not similarly prevent us from discussing method at all. Just as we do not begin with \u201cprescience or method\u201d for fear of finding nothing but someone else's teacher, finding nothing but method\u2019s surety and ignorance of method\u2019s doubting and questioning stance, so we do not begin with \u201clies and method\u201d for fear of finding ourselves as 'first' teacher, for fear of finding in method only whatever is after its stalemate, and finding only the decreasingly deft and increasingly barren maneuvering of a method that has been disallowed from nourishing itself. We do not begin with \u201clies and method\u201d for fear that method never returns to stalemate to confront the possibility that thought may have lied and thereafter inhabited method\u2019s passage. When we begin with precise notions of prescience and from there formulate some notion of method, we find only what we want to find, and find only the qualities in method which show it at its most successful. When we begin with precise notions of lies and from there formulate some\r\nway of properly practicing method, we unnecessarily condemn method to live only on the lie on which thought may have habituated itself for today\u2019s writing, and thereby condemn method to live only on that lie to which thought has habituated itself and <i>from</i> which thought cannot arrive, when denied its repose. \u00a0Then: we disallow method from entering stalemate and recuperating itself, we disallow its practice of its deftness, and so we disallow method from continuing thoughtfulness. Then: we allow method only the bland thinking that remains satisfied, and never the thinking that grows out of some lie and perhaps, but perhaps not, into another.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo can we begin by asking: lies <i>or</i> method? We ask this not to court another line of questioning in which we wonder whether we can bring lies and method together at the beginning, but to wonder whether there must be catastrophe between our perusal of any method and our cultivation of our own lies. Though method\u2019s practice may demand lies, does method\u2019s passage into practice, as passage, confront the notion that the thinker lies as a notion catastrophic for method? We ask this and we ask: if we as thinkers have learned to lie in our habitual and ill-begun practice of method, is it possible to afterwards take up method as passage from the repose of thought to an applied methodology, or do we remain in the rarified air of stalemate and mystery? If we without lies question method in order to begin its proper passage, must we steel ourselves to remain before method\u2019s questionable nature occurs to us, lest our thought&mdash;apart from method&mdash;begins to lie? \r\n</p>",

            "rendered_content": "<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In his article \u201cSelf-Destruction as Spiritual Practice,\u201d Michael Kinnucan writes: \u201cOur culture has forgotten Christian mysticism, almost entirely and surprisingly quickly. Perhaps we should congratulate ourselves. Our ethical practices, in their teeming variety, aim one and all at happiness in this life, and they mostly seek it through an apotheosis of selfhood; to become what one is in the time that one has is our goal, and even our Christians expect a reward for their efforts.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs a counter to his assertions concerning Christian mysticism, I offer a brief study of the life and thought of Simone Weil, a mystical figure whose beliefs and practices were in certain ways analogous to St. Teresa\u2019s. Unlike St. Teresa, however, Weil was a modern figure whose mysticism seems impossible to disassociate from the conditions Nietzsche describes as the death of God. Weil\u2019s mysticism took as its premise the notion of divine absence and the forsakenness of the material world\u2014in other words, her mysticism was not an anachronism, but a corollary of modernity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>* * *</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>Simone Weil was born in Paris in 1909 to a secular family of Jewish ancestry. Her father was a respected physician, and the family lived in comfortable circumstances. Her brother Andr\u00e9 Weil, who would go on to become a great mathematician, played a significant role in his sister\u2019s spiritual development. In a letter to her friend Father Perrin, Weil wrote:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nAt fourteen I fell into one of those fits of bottomless despair that come with adolescence, and I seriously thought of dying because of the mediocrity of my natural faculties. The exceptional gifts of my brother, who had a childhood and youth comparable to those of Pascal, brought my own inferiority home to me. I did not mind having no visible successes, but what did grieve me was the idea of being excluded from that transcendent kingdom to which only the truly great have access and wherein truth abides. I preferred to die rather than live without truth.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWeil\u2019s longing for truth led her to seek out experiences that would allow her to enter into the \u201ctranscendent kingdom\u201d through a different route than her brother\u2019s; to experience the loss of self through factory work. The experience would remain central to her thought even as her concern with industrial rights gave way to her political activism.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWeil devoted herself to the pursuit of truth through the study of all religions. She looked to worldwide religious beliefs for the transcendent wisdom of all humankind, deriving much of her thought not only from Christian doctrine but also from the traditions of the Upanishads, Buddhism, Taoism, and Greek tragedy. As for the religion of her ancestors\u2014Judaism\u2014Weil harbored an intense disdain. The Book of Job, which she calls \u201ca marvel of truth and authenticity,\u201d is perhaps the sole exception to her categorical rejection of Judaism and the Old Testament.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDespite her miserable estimation of her own faculties, Weil graduated with highest honors from the \u00c9cole Normale Superieur with a degree in philosophy. Following her graduation, she took up a teaching post at a lyc\u00e9e in Le Puy. In her spare time, she participated in union-organizing and socialized with the unemployed. She refused to eat more than those who received rations on the relief. Weil spent her year on sabbatical laboring in a Renault automobile factory:\r\n<blockquote>As I worked in the factory, indistinguishable to all eyes, including my own, from the anonymous mass, the affliction of others entered into my flesh and my soul. Nothing separated me from it, for I had really forgotten my past and I looked forward to no future, finding it difficult to imagine the possibility of surviving all the fatigue. What I went through there marked me in so lasting a manner that still today when any human being, whoever he may be and in whatever circumstances, speaks to me without brutality, I cannot help having the impression that there must be a mistake and that unfortunately the mistake will in all probability disappear. There I received forever the mark of a slave, like the branding of the red-hot iron the Romans put on the foreheads of their most despised slaves. Since then I have always regarded myself as a slave.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was her experience in the factory that taught Weil that human beings possess nothing in the world; that a mere chance can take away everything except the ability to say \u201cI.\u201d The \u201cI\u201d is what we must dedicate to God, and in so doing we destroy the \u201cI.\u201d The state of perfection in a human soul, according to Weil, comes about when affliction can no longer destroy the \u201cI\u201d because the \u201cI\u201d no longer exists\u2014such is the state of the soul which has been completely dedicated to God. On the other hand, the ultimate affliction, and the soul\u2019s state of perfection arise in the feeling of God\u2019s absence (\u201cMy God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\u201d) \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTo be stripped of the power to say \u201cI\u201d is to undergo an extreme affliction, of which there are two kinds: the kind inflicted on the individual from without, and the kind inflicted by the individual on himself. An individual who does not affirm his affliction does not perceive that he has lost himself. This sort of affliction by itself destroys the \u201cI\u201d without the individual perceiving this to be the case&mdash;indeed, he may retain a \u201cnaked, vegetative egoism,\u201d by way of his inner revolt against the external forces that cause him harm. To undergo affliction from within, the person must accept the harm done to him without any inner revolt, accept that he is afflicted, and thus he aids in his own destruction of self. Sufferings must be accepted passively, not experienced as a test of strength or endurance, but as a \u201ctestimony, lived and felt, of human misery.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWeil also learned in the factory the necessity of imparting affliction on one\u2019s self by way of renouncing the illusion of time: \u201cThe past and the future hinder the wholesome effect of affliction by providing an unlimited field for imaginary elevation. That is why the renunciation of past and future is the first of all renunciations.\u201d The past and the future are man\u2019s illusory belongings. Weil illustrates idea with the example of a miser who loses his treasure\u2014his loss is a loss of a precious piece of an imaginary frozen past. The future is also an illusion; \u201ca filler of voids,\u201d of which eternity is the only cure: \u201cWhen pain and weariness reach the point of causing a sense of perpetuity to be born in the soul, through contemplating this perpetuity with acceptance and love, we are snatched away into eternity.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1936, Weil fought alongside the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War and joined an anarchist paramilitary group, but her physical clumsiness endangered her fellow militants, and after an accident in which she scalded herself with hot cooking oil, she had to abandon the war effort, and left for Portugal with her parents to recuperate. It was in a small Portuguese town, listening to the fisherman singing hymns \u201cof a heart-rending sadness\u201d at a festival for the town\u2019s patron saint, that Weil became convinced that \u201cChristianity is pre-eminently the religion of slaves, that slaves cannot help belonging to it, and [she herself] among others.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn 1937 in Assisi, and again in 1938 in Solesmes, Weil underwent mystical encounters, described in her <i>Spiritual Autobiography.</i> In her <i>Spiritual Autobiography</i> she recounts the experience at Solesmes:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\tIn 1938 I spent ten days at Solesmes, from Palm Sunday to Easter Tuesday, following all the liturgical services. I was suffering from splitting headaches; each sound hurt me like a blow; by an extreme effort of concentration I was able to rise above this wretched flesh, to leave it to suffer by itself, heaped in a corner, and to find a pure and perfect joy in the unimaginable beauty of the chanting and the words. This experience enabled me by analogy to get a better understanding of the possibility of loving divine love in the midst of affliction. It goes without saying that in the course of these services the thought of the Passion of Christ entered into my being once and for all.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt the beginning of World War II, Weil lived with her parents in Paris, Vichy and Marseilles. In 1942 Weil fled with her parents from Nazi-occupied France to the United States. She wished to return to France and join the Resistance, but unable to do so during the occupation, Weil went instead to England. There she contracted tuberculosis. Refusing to eat more than the rations allotted to her compatriots, Weil compromised her already fragile physical health. She died of self-induced starvation in a sanatorium in Ashford, England in 1943, at the age of 34.\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nI need God to take me by force, because, if death, doing away with the shield of the flesh, were to put me face to face with him, I should run away.\r\n</blockquote>",

Four is the blue floor\u2014not to be confused with the red, yellow or green floors of this college dormitory that\u2019s some kind of cross between a hospital on acid trip and a riot-proof nursery school for toddlers with delicate dispositions.  </p>\r\n<p>Three books by the same philosopher remain open on my desk.  I am going to kill this philosopher: </p>\r\n<blockquote>To posit such an alternative is to be too quick to take as read what is in fact in question: identification of the discussion proper to political rationality and to its manifestation of what is just and unjust with a certain speech-act situation.  The rationality of dialogue is thereby identified with the relationship between speakers addressing each other in the grammatical mode of the first and second persons in order to oppose each other\u2019s interest and value systems\u2026</blockquote>\r\n<p>But then I am not really going to kill this philosopher. Because I\u2019ve already exhausted my final brain-unit of investment in text, and so I\u2019m no longer really capable of resenting the empty abstraction of these words. These words hardly reach me.  All I can think is: not this. </p>\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n<p>At some point in college, I lost touch with whatever meaning political theory once held for me.  From my present vantage point, it\u2019s easy to characterize this sense of loss as really the birth pangs of an interest in urban policy.  But at the time I was aware only of an inability to respond to ideas intelligently in a way that had once defined me.  Before identifying myself with a new way of seeing\u2014before articulating the limitations of a perspective I\u2019d once held dear\u2014I became lost in the negative, no longer able to access any aspect of my self-concept, not yet able to consider the prospect of affirming a reworked identity anew. Often, it is only much later and from a position of detachment that we can piece together some notion of our development. Ascribing an arc to experience retroactively, we circumscribe negative moments within a broader narrative of positive identity. </p>\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Now something that you formerly loved as a truth or probability strikes you as an error: you shed it and fancy that this represents a victory for your reason. But perhaps this error was as necessary for you then, when you were still a different person\u2014you are always a different person\u2014, as are all your present \"truths\", being a skin, as it were, that concealed and covered a great deal that you were not permitted to see. What killed that opinion for you was your new life and not your reason: you no longer need it, and now it collapses and unreason crawls out of it into the light like a worm. When we criticize something, this is no arbitrary and impersonal event,\u2014it is, at least very often, evidence of vital energies in us that are growing and shedding a skin. We negate and must negate because something in us wants to live and affirm, something that we perhaps do not know or see as yet! \u2014 This is said in favor of criticism (246). </p>\r\n<p>\u2014 Nietzsche, The Gay Science, \u00a7307 </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In college I may have felt that every last ounce of my energy was being channeled into a broad renunciation of academia, yet my self-contained impulse to negate had already begun to set future affirmations in motion.  The shedding of one skin is a sign that a new skin has already begun to grow.  The image of skin\u2014one Nietzsche invokes several times throughout The Gay Science and in his other works\u2014provides a rich metaphor for the category of truth in the context of identity.  I don\u2019t think the terms \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cerror\u201d have to point to any super-specific content here.  I take Nietzsche to mean negative and affirmative postures of selfhood, which contribute to the way we think about ourselves and represent our thoughts and actions to others. </p>\r\n<p>When we distance ourselves from an idea, activity, or relationship we once held dear, there is a tendency to affix a logic to this process in retrospect.  Perhaps we declare our former beliefs to have been simply the residue of na\u00efvet\u00e9, a product of immaturity, an upshot of immersion in the wrong context.  And yet there is no guarantee that\u2014not even an apparatus for measuring whether\u2014the past perspectives we shed are false, while the new ones we affirm are true. While Nietzsche\u2019s aphorism is written in favor of a critical posture that enables ever-new selves to be born, he by no means equates criticism with the linear progress of the self. </p>\r\n<p>Shedding a skin that \u201cconcealed and covered a great deal that you were not permitted to see\u201d enables one to see something new,<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup> but this doesn\u2019t mean that one is always seeing something better or more true than what came before.  Each skin at once reveals and conceals anew.  At the center of any \u201ctruth\u201d lies a core of subjective sightlessness, blind both to the truth which preceded it and to the new way of seeing into which it will eventually unfold.  More basically, what a good truth conceals is its nature as a skin\u2014as a way of seeing the world that can and will be shed.  In this sense, each truth conceals our potential to love any number of other truths, to exist in the world in any number of other ways.</p>\r\n<p>In drawing out Nietzsche\u2019s aphorism, it becomes clear that the process of skin-shedding always involves both gains and losses.  At the same time that one is gaining new perspective, one must lose immediate, subjective access to some former way of being in the world.  Sure, if you once identified yourself as a fiction writer but no longer do, you can still experience a great love for fiction writing. Yet the valence of this love will be different from that of an identification; the relationship you construct between the desire to write and your self-concept\u2014between the act of writing and the way you present yourself to others\u2014will not be the same.</p>\r\n<p>To have experienced life within one skin and then to no longer exist and engage with the world from within that skin\u2014such a loss can only be perceived obliquely, from the too-late horizon of nostalgia.  By the time we\u2019ve put enough distance between ourselves and the past to judge it as error, we\u2019ve probably already lost touch with the \u201cfeeling of real\u201d a truth once held for us, as an aspect of our identity. In the end, identity is itself neither more nor less than a skin: it is a layer which defines the irreducible containment of our inner lives at the same time as it represents our surface area for engagement with the external world in a particular time and place. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is through negative moments of criticism, which know only how to pronounce the errors of the past, that ever-new selves are born and identity remains dynamic\u2014this is said in favor of criticism.  And yet the very form of this rejection reproduces the static streak in identity. It is precisely the terminology of error and truth, affixed to processes of negation and affirmation, which enable us to be so blind to the infinity of other ways in which it is always possible to define identity.  Ultimately, the dynamism of identity is always tied up with its tendency toward stasis; the very movement by which identity contracts, expands, and shifts is never distant from its wish to be fixed, from its definition as a process of fixing. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Negative, critical and narrative postures all contribute to the suspension of identity between dynamism and stasis, to its defining tension between radical and conservative tendencies.  On the one hand, the retroactive imposition of a logical narrative obscures the messy process of negation and covers over the uncomfortable posture of self-critique.  Reason, swooping in after the fact, distances identity from the erraticness of everyday life.  Negations and affirmations which shift over the course of a day or week are thus written off as merely the spasms of pesky necessity: that you are so susceptible\u2014to hormones and weather and degrees of caffeination and t minus the impetus to do laundry\u2014is tolerated, but ultimately transcended. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A radical critique of static identity would then seem to open out from the negative posture, which reacts against the status quo so as to grope boldly toward unknown parts of the self.  Only by \u201ctarrying with the negative\u201d can we let go of our compulsion to narrate progress, with its attendant pressure to hold on to anything definite. And to the Hypocrite Readers who think their critical capacity renders them less susceptible to some bullshit mythos of Progress: I have a hunch that our ways of thinking, speaking and acting are motivated by narratives of Progress toward a True Self more often than we\u2019d like to think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a different angle, however, the process of retroactive narration also unsettles identity.  When you find yourself in a new city, on a new drug, surrounded by new people, you need not force unfamiliar experiences to fit within the bounds of your present self-concept.  Rather, definitions shift to incorporate new phenomena over time.  In this way, the retroactive assignment of meaning actually challenges static identifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, the dynamic process of criticism whereby one is always a different person can't be sundered from the invention of a reasonable self, which transcends shifting negations and affirmations so as to narrate progress from above.  There is no domain of selfhood that transcends the process of skin-shedding, yet neither is there any iteration of the self which escapes this desire for transcendence.\r\n<img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a> See also Aph. 143, The greatest advantage of polytheism: \u201cIn polytheism the free-spiriting and many-spiriting of man attained its first preliminary form\u2014the strength to create for ourselves our own new eyes\u2014and ever again new eyes that are even more our own: hence man alone among all the animals has no eternal horizons and perspectives.\u201d</p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>In the early decades of the thirteenth century, the Jews of Christendom were abuzz with disapproval and concern regarding two dangerous works of Jewish heresy and their author, Moses Maimonides. His legal opus, the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, and his major scholastic work, <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i>, are thoroughly respected and widely read by all kinds of Jews today, but in the immediate aftermath of their widespread translation and dissemination, they were the object of a flurry of controversy. Bans were issued, polemics written, letters of attack and conciliation exchanged. This Maimonidean controversy came to an abrupt end in 1233, when the <i>Guide</i> was burnt by Dominican inquisitors in France.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maimonides was suspected by the Jews of Christendom primarily because of the deep incorporation of Aristotelian philosophy into his works. In Muslim regions, such repurposing of pagan philosophy was <i>de rigueur</i>, but under Christendom it was a scary venture. The Church had recently launched a brand new campaign against heresy, and it made the Jews nervous. The Church had previously maintained a policy of detached ignorance of Jewish writings\u2014this was the first major inquiry by the medieval Church into Jewish ideas. The Jews\u2019 trepidation was directed specifically at the Guide and its unabashed Aristotelianism. They were worried that its pagan influence would be detected by inquisitors and thereby cast a shadow of suspicion on the entire Jewish corpus. The irony of history is that their fears were justified\u2014the burning of the <i>Guide</i> in 1233 was followed by a seizure of Jewish books generally in 1239 and an examination of the Talmud in 1247\u2014but they nonetheless silenced their own criticisms of the <i>Guide</i> following the trauma of the Dominican response. A single act of violent disruption brought a whole emerging discourse to its knees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The philosophical bias which permeates so much of the thinking in this debate inevitably bleeds into our own thoughts about it as well. We tend to accept the basically idealistic positions of the debaters and abstract arguments from circumstance. The Dominican intervention is for us a helpful reminder of all of the less visible vicissitudes which conditioned its ideas. One must to some extent leave space for these different textures. This was a controversy which spanned the geographic bounds of Jewish civilization. Micro-practices, small customs, and pieties must be presumed to have varied somewhat from place to place. We know the political authorities and dominant cultures varied drastically in their treatment of the Jews and in their receptivity towards religious and philosophical creativity. Some rabbis we encounter were community leaders, and had to pay close attention to the lives of their followers; others were primarily scholars and participated more exclusively in academic discourses. One must also remember that, whereas Christian theological history can be seen as a welter of schisms and heresies, the smallness and fragility of the Jewish worlds brought its scholars that much more quickly to compromise and unity. Finally, it must be stressed that these are Jewish worlds, in the plural, and that these letters are in many respects the discursive glue that brings them together. The thousands of miles that separate Maimonides from his fiercest opponents should not be forgotten, even in this philosophical context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before we wade into the secondary stages of the controversy, I ought to briefly characterize the theology of Maimonides himself, though the terrifyingly extensive scholarship on the subject will undoubtedly make me look like an ignorant fool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon his entry into it, the study of systematic theology was a fairly quiet subject in Judaism. He was not the first to attempt a systematic theology, nor was he the first to attempt a coherent hybridization of Judaism with Greek philosophy. But he was definitely the most influential and controversial. He was also the first to go so far as to declare the study of philosophy a religious obligation, instead of simply permitting it. Theological statements in the Talmud are decidedly unsystematic, and it is often bewilderingly unclear if the are meant in a literal, allegorical, or even mystical mode. The Bible itself, to our eyes at least, portrays a deeply non-Aristotelian God as a continuously evolving character of enormous and fluid affect with a real investment and dramatic involvement in human lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maimonides does not use either the Bible or the Talmud as the foundation of his theology. He uses as his foundation his understanding of Greek philosophy and a discourse of reason that is essentially imported from the surrounding Arabic philosophical culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He begins his <i>Foundations of the Torah</i>\u2014the first volume of the <i>Book of Knowledge</i>, and therefore the very beginning of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>\u2014by declaring the logical necessity of a first cause. The first two paragraphs delineate all which that first cause necessarily entails: that nothing which does exist does so without this cause, that it is existentially independent of all else, that it is epistemologically distinct from all else. All of this precedes his designation of this first cause as being none other than God, the Lord of the world. Within the context of the study of philosophical theologies, it can be easy to forget the alarming novelty of this approach. By articulating God in terms of reason, he effectively subordinates God to reason. This, at least, was a charge leveled against him by his opponents\u2014and the reluctant atheists and pantheists of our day will recognize it as the first step towards the Enlightenment mutiny of reason against God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, the Torah takes itself as evidence of its own authority. Thus it implies all at once the existence of God, the fact of his authority, and its specific content. Within the regime of reason, even in an age where it sleeps comfortably with the idea of God, this assent to the basic facts of God is atomized into separate appeals to which we assent individually. We ought to dwell on the significance of the move in theology from mythic to philosophical authority. It effectively redirects the monotheistic critical faculty from the idea of the false god to the truth of the idea of God at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other important element of his theology is his rigorously anti-conceptual concept of God. There are two main elements to this concept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first is that God has no physical-anthropomorphic features. Any biblical or rabbinic language which suggests otherwise\u2014His strong hand, His outstretched arm, His face\u2014is meant to be understood as metaphorical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second is that it is just as much an anthropomorphic fallacy to imagine that God has any positive conceptual qualities whatsoever. The descriptors which populate our liturgy and our thought\u2014that God is merciful, that God is patient, etc.\u2014are also metaphorical. or more accurately, they are descriptions of our own so-called 'experience' of God, which is inherently finite. Since there are observable effects of God's action, and we know that if a human being were to act in such a way they would be described as merciful or patient, we attach those descriptors as handles to the ungraspable essence of God. Thus, to study and to pray in these positive terms and meanwhile to believe them in a straightforward way\u2014this is wrongheaded and ignorant. Furthermore, it is idolatrous. This is why the believing Jew must acquire some philosophical acumen, to avoid falling prey to traps laid within his own canon. This brings the monotheistic critical impulse to bear not only onto the realm of concepts, but also on the canon itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This anti-corporealist dogma apparently remains quite popular among philosophical theologians today, encouraged of course by Kant. People like Jean-Luc Marion declare that idolatry should be understood as the worship of God within \u2018experience,\u2019 which is to say, within the autonomy of reason. Since this is a living theological position, I can comfortably admit to disliking it. It is steeped in what Nietzsche refers to as the philosopher's bias. What the philosopher imbues with supreme importance, he says, is not much more than a reflection of a philosopher's predilections\u2014broadly, that he loves thinking, and therefore is biased towards valuing what can be done with thoughts over what can be done with less philosophical modes of action. This is a Platonic kind of bias\u2014it imagines an ideal world of concepts over and above the world of life. As Maimonides himself declares, the greatest human good is in the contemplation of highest things. Thus the nested series of values which inform the Kantian God: (1) He cannot be approached through experience, because experience, given as it is to specificity, is really a kind of lie. Or at least it muddies the real, the concept, the true, the universal. (2) Experience is synonymous with the rule of reason. This is because all experience is ordered and mediated by concepts. (3) Concepts themselves are also human creations, and therefore (a) God is outside of them\u2014that is, in no way intelligible to reason, and (b) violation of this philosophical doctrine is a kind of idolatry, because the worship of a concept is worship of a human creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It shows the extent to which this debate has become irrelevant in 800 years that such a claim\u2014na\u00efvet\u00e9 to a whole array of sophisticated philosophical propositions as tantamount to idolatry\u2014can pass without much consternation. It transforms the whole of the human relation to God into a high-concept mind game. This naturally favors a specific hierarchy of truth and knowledge, one which we see in force already in Maimonides, who effectively transforms what it means to seek knowledge of God. God is great because God is most true; knowledge of that highest truth is theoretical knowledge of the highest quality, knowledge so rarefied that we cannot really have it. As Nietzsche would say, this may be truth, but it may also be useless. The question that faces us non-Kantians today is thus: what other kinds of knowledge can we imagine? What new practices of theological truth can we engage? Is there a non-philosophical method for the knowledge of God? In order to move on from Kantian theology, we need to distance ourselves from its philosophical presuppositions and consider alternatives to each\u2014what if God really can, in some way, be articulated within experience? Not just conceptual experience, but experience of the living world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A generation after Maimonides, his ideas were under even greater scrutiny and criticism than in his lifetime. Rabbi Avraham, the son of Maimonides, was tasked with the defense of his father's legacy. He was born in the 51st year of his father's life, and inherited his father's statue upon his death\u2014thus becoming both the head of Egyptian Jewry and court physician of the royal house at the young age of 18. In contrast to the unsettled life of his father, he lived and worked his entire life in Egypt. He was apparently gifted with a remarkable kind of persuasive authority\u2014his efforts led to the acceptance of rabbinic normativity by the Karaites of Egypt. But much of his brilliance in scholarship was marshaled to his father's defense. He wrote a vitriolic letter to the rabbis of Provence, whose defiant polemic tone (it was titled \u201cBook of the Wars of God\u201d) stated a Maimonidean position in much angrier, more forceful phrasing than his father ever used. This can be seen in the distinctness of his phrasing of the corporealist heresy. His father defines a corporealist as \u201cone who says there is one God but that he is embodied and that he has an image.\u201d His son's corresponding definition has a verbose comprehensiveness: \u201cA dissenter who says that the creator has any kind of likeness, figure, or image, or something that resembles a body or any kind of boundary or anything like that.\u201d It is hard to know if he has a specific shade of the offense in mind when he rattles off all of these terms, or if they are meant to be intimidating by their redundancy alone.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless, his work is of interest because it makes an explicit claim against living people in a way in which Maimonides never does directly. He states the tenets of negative theology, and then says:</p> \r\n\r\n<blockquote>This much is understood without doubt by every Jew living in Arab lands, as well as by some of the Jews of Christendom living in the south of Spain. Even the Arabs have adapted this article of faith from Israel and built their own religion upon its foundation. [\u2026] So it has been heard, that multitudes from across the sea, island dwellers, and those from far off places, have erred as to this basic principle, and cling to the literal meanings of those biblical, midrashic, and aggadic passages. This sickens our heart and darkens our eyes. Our ancestors are dumbstruck\u2014how can this impurity be within Israel, this impurity of idolatry? This is a rejection of God's service, they serve other gods beside him\u2026One who does not know this is an apostate and idolater\u2014his service is not to God, but rather to his own reflection! A reflection that is a product of their own minds!</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Corporealism is not only foolish, it is idolatry. The inverse of sound monotheistic worship of that which created you; it is a distorted worship of an image of the self. He frames philosophical monotheism as the pure strain of Jewish belief and sees corporealism as the synthetic strain, sullied by Christian superstitions (this is a helpful opposite to the reason-revelation cliche of rationalistic synthesis versus mystical purity). He constructs this plague of idolatry as an element of geographic otherness\u2014these idolaters are within Judaism, but they are nonetheless Others. The geographic expanse is evident in his writing\u2014he admits that his accusations are matters of hearsay. These are far off barbaric lands, where these heretical Jews dwell; we have only the faintest notion of them, only through the angry letters which we write to each other about doctrine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But despite the haze of distance, he is audacious enough to assert that vast quantities of Jews are, knowingly or not, guilty of heresy. This kind of accusation is based on a theory of history which he shares with his father. According to both, Jewish civilization is plagued with progressive civic and religious deterioration. In the preface to the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, Maimonides decries the present state of Jewry, that \"the wisdom of our sages has disappeared, and the understanding of our discerning men is hidden.\" This diagnosis is part of his justification for writing a work like the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. Like his father, R. Avraham decries the weakened state of contemporary Jewry, but there is both a shift in his object of concern\u2014from halakhic to theological\u2014and the introduction of specific geographic bounds to the problem. His main concern is a failure of theological knowledge, and in effect he proposes a massive retraining of the theological conceptions of all the Jews of Christendom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This kind of disdain for the spiritual intuition of the Jewish people is relatively rare amongst medieval rabbis (though it resonates amongst modernists). It is more common for medieval rabbis to justify common practice as necessarily true and good, and adjust their philosophical standards accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rabbi Avraham ben David (henceforth the Rabad), a contemporary of Maimonides and a famous critic of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, exemplifies this approach. He takes issue with the Maimonidean definition of corporealist idolatry not because he thinks it untrue or unsound\u2014he takes issue with the severity of his designation and its inherent disrespect for generations of Jews before him. \"Why did he call such a person a heretic, when some who were greater and better than he followed this opinion, according to what they found in the Bible and even more, according to what they found in <i>aggadot</i> which corrupt opinions?\" In other words, how can you fault anyone for believing what they read?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Rabad attacks Maimonides on this point, he insists on a distinction between what is wrong and what is idolatry. The crux of the struggle is not the incompatibility of reason and revelation. Understanding it thusly implies the solution, replicating the perceived struggle between religion and the truth. The struggle is actually this protest of the Rabad: whether or not there is space in a system of theological knowledge for error that is not idolatrous error. This struggle implies an equally significant converse: that there can be idolatry outside of the conceptual realm. So, the struggle can be phrased as such: is idolatry an ideal category, a conceptual defect, or is it a failure of practice? If the Rabad is defending an old conception that Maimonides has overthrown, what are the implications? What does the realignment of true and false worship into a philosophical regime of truth practices mean for Jewish existence broadly?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This philosophical revolution does indeed have implications in practice. In short, I believe that the philosophical revolution in theology is connected to a reification of the halakha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This claim can be traced through the Rabad\u2019s critique of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During Maimonides' lifetime, the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> was the work which attracted the large share of scrutiny and debate. This is because, in the realm of halakhic writing, it is a radical departure from tradition, and to a certain extent a bold negation thereof. While not explicitly philosophical, it is thoroughly saturated with a Platonic order of knowledge and understanding of truth. It was in some sense more audacious than the <i>Guide</i>. While the <i>Guide</i> was written for a specific audience (the perplexed), the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> was meant to have universal application. Its stated purpose is a comprehensive, authoritative restatement of all of the Oral Law. It was meant to serve as a substitute for the study of Talmud.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two major significant features of this codification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(1) It is a systematic reordering of the Oral Law\u2014the first new taxonomy of halakha since the Mishnah itself. Prior works of Oral Law were organized along with the Talmud's own taxonomy, which meant that access to any of them demanded a familiarity with the bewildering labyrinthine system of the Talmud itself. Thus, the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> had an independence from the <i>gemara</i> that other works never had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(2) It is written as a monolithic entity. That is, it does not replicate talmudic disputes, offers no rationales for rulings chosen, and does not cite sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The origins of this monolithic codification lie in the anti-aristocratic aspect of Maimonides\u2019 thought. Under the dominant mode of leadership at the time, community leaders\u2014<i>geonim</i>\u2014had unquestioned authority and an aristocratic authority of power and continuity. Maimonides was thoroughly opposed to this entrenched power, and bemoaned its grip upon a tragically ignorant populace. As in the age of the Mishnah, this condition is symptomatic of a general decline of civilization. Thus, he imagines the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> serving a parallel function to the Mishnah itself in its time\u2014as an intervention and resurrection of Jewish intellectual culture. He envisions a future in which the whole Oral Law would be thoroughly known by all. His grand vision is of a universally well-educated populace, that need not rely on the <i>geonim</i> and their difficult knowledge. His erasure of the multiplicity of previous halakhic works is carried out in the name of popular accessibility. The <i>Mishneh Torah</i> is a kind of Protestant Reformation of halakha\u2014the Talmud is impenetrable to plebeian inquiry, and requires the mediation of interpretive expertise, which is invested in local authority. The <i>Mishneh Torah</i> is eminently readable by all. It eliminates mediation in favor of direct access. It says\u2014why not try this by yourself? Why ask an expert when you could ask a book?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rabad's critique problematizes this utopianism. He sharply criticizes Maimonides for dispensing with source citation, and supplements the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with his own painstakingly researched citations from the <i>gemara</i> and parallel sources. He also cries foul whenever he cannot find a satisfactory talmudic source. He thus undermines Maimonides' vision of an independent work, by declaring it incomplete without his supplement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is also perplexed as to why Maimonides pretends that his work can supersede not only the Talmud but also the particularities of local practice. \u201cBut this way, I do not know why I should disregard my tradition and my proof for the sake of this author\u2019s book\u2026If the one who differs with me is greater than I\u2014fine; and, if I am greater than he, why should I annul my opinion in deference to his?\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He accuses Maimonides, in other words, of replicating the harm he claimed to fix. He simply transfers opaque authority from geonic authority to the authority of a book. The common reader of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> hasn't established an unmediated connection with halakha, he has merely deferred to the authority of the printed page. The critique of the Rabad is that bookish authority is fundamentally different from geonic authority. While geonic authority is local, interpersonal, and adapted to circumstance, the authority of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> is universal, equally applicable anywhere. By writing this opaque, anti-critical code of halakha, Maimonides transforms halakha from a localized practice of expert consultation and talmudic exegesis to one of universalized programmatic action. This preference for books over experts is a product of a logic of universal discourse, of the idea that everything you do and think needs to be intelligible to everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is, of course, the same universal logic which informs philosophical theology. They share the same disdain for the local, the experiential, the imperfections of the living world. When knowledge of God becomes a project of quixotic philosophizing, the character of halakha changes as well. Halakha, as within experience, can no longer be conceived of as a method for the knowledge of God. It is deprived of its telos, and reconfigured as a self-contained immovable system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the aftermath of postmodernism, we might finally choose to abandon the convoluted philosophical pieties of negative theologies, and look elsewhere for knowledge of God, allowing for the possibility that, with a sound \u201cmethod,\u201d not of knowing but of practicing, we might be capable of finding truth in our own experience. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

When she got there, camp gave her stories to brag about to kids at school: There were not only outhouses but also trough sinks and, three times a week, showers with water heated by fire and delivered by hoses. Editing information was important, because no one needed to know she\u2019d never wear the shirt she tie-dyed again or that she refused to take an advanced swim test that involved a scary surface dive. The girls in her bunk\u2014cleverly named Sleepy Hollow\u2014talked about mascara a lot. Jamie, who slept in the cot next to hers, had large, clear print. Jamie wrote letters every day after lunch in nice, thick, colored markers, and the girl knew who in Jamie\u2019s family knew what. <i>Tell Robert thanks for the letter. \u201cHi. Hope camp is fun. Work is boring. Bye.\u201d We had spaghetti again for dinner last night. Today I went off the rope swing.</i> Jamie\u2019s letters were endlessly interesting until the day she started to shield them better with her left hand while she wrote with her right. Then Jamie traded cots with Amy, who wrote in slanted ballpoint.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3.</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nUsually, though, her parents sent her to the day camp run by the local university in the summers. Everything about day camp was less interesting because not only was it a five-minute drive from home, but you didn\u2019t get to sleep in a row with a dozen other girls every night. No one got mail and boys were less interesting because groups were coed. One morning, the girl waited in line in a concrete stairwell to sign in at the backdoor of the gym. Some kids knew one another and compared brownbag lunches, but she just stood there, waiting her turn. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d A boy in a baseball cap behind her tapped her on the shoulder. She turned around to face him. \u201cAre you a boy or a girl?\u201d the boy asked. The girl tried to sneer, but mostly her voice just came out a little lower than usual: \u201cWhat do you <i>think</i>?\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4.</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nOn sunny days, she can leave the house barefoot. She really, really likes the distinct feelings of solid concrete and damp grass below her. Even better is counting what she has on her. One shirt plus one pair of underpants plus one pair of shorts equals three. Errands require shoes, school a backpack. When her mother finally allows her to grow out her hair, messier than it is curly, she needs a rubber band.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5.</h3>\r\n<p>It\u2019s the night before Halloween. The artsy kids, the cool kids at school, don\u2019t always dress up, and it\u2019s hard to know where to land to merit inclusion in their crowd. The stoner boys will wear their corduroys, maybe rubber masks. The party girls who sneak out of their windows at night will wear devil horns almost uniformly. Some of them will also wear fishnets. The kids who read sci-fi will wear cloaks they\u2019ve sewn themselves. Some girls will dress up as fairies\u2014store-bought wings and glittery makeup\u2014but the girl did that last year. She stares at her closet. There\u2019s a peasant top she\u2019s never worn to school because it hangs across her chest differently than her regular t-shirts do, and she doesn\u2019t like to have to think about the fact that she has breasts. Maybe she should wear this tomorrow and call herself a hippie. She clambers up the stairs. \u201cHey, Mom, can I borrow your patchwork skirt?\u201d The girl is not as skinny as her mother was in the seventies,  but sometimes she can still shimmy into her mom\u2019s old clothes. \u201cYes, but you can\u2019t let anything happen to it. I made it from a kit I sent away for in college, you know.\u201d So this just means she can\u2019t spill yogurt on it at lunch. Fine. She tries it on and safety pins it every few inches to hem it. Hippies might have worn skirts below the knee, but that won\u2019t fly at her school now. She runs out of pins and turns to packing tape. It\u2019ll only be on the inside, so no one will see. She calls her father at work and asks to borrow his antiwar armband. He gives in, but threatens unnamed consequences if anything should happen to it. She complains that it won\u2019t stay put on her scrawny bicep. \u201cKid,\u201d he says, \u201cthat\u2019s because most parts of the world are cold. We pinned those to our jackets. They\u2019re not supposed to stay put on skin.\u201d But it\u2019s supposed to be sunny tomorrow and long sleeves look dumb, anyway.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn English class the next day, the girl and her friend Sally giggle over how Tara is wearing white short shorts over neon orange fishnets and roller-skating to her desk. While Mrs. Stevens passes back essays on <i>A Doll\u2019s House,</i> Sally asks the girl why she didn\u2019t dress up. \u201cI did!\u201d the girl insists. \u201cLook. I\u2019m supposed to be a hippie.\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d Sally says. \u201cThat\u2019s what you wear every day.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6.</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nHer friend Daniel goes for black-and-white leading ladies. Barbara Stanwyck, Ingrid Bergman. In color, Helena Bonham Carter for the way she smokes in <i>Fight Club</i>. Mysterious women smoke really, really well. The girl\u2019s winter coat is puffy. Mysterious women wear trenches. Mysterious women look like Carmen Sandiego, that cartoon criminal. Mysterious women provoke m\u00e9nages \u00e0 trois when they appear in the French New Wave. Mysterious women are the object of the imperative <i>Cherchez la femme</i> in film noir, but they possess an awful lot of invisible agency. Mysterious women are alluring. They lure with the secrets that are not known, that cannot be known (in this world, of course, in which there are two types of secrets: those to which one is among the privileged few privy, and those the content of which one is unaware and the existence of which one may well also be unaware). Daniel tells her she\u2019ll never be mysterious, but together they (somewhat platonically) pine for intimacy with the women around them they think pull it off.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMysterious women can retain mystery because they don\u2019t need intimacy with anyone. Mysterious women do not discuss their mystery or that of anyone else. Mysterious women are tied down to nothing. No one, no thing. They can fade into air because they have no obligations on earth. Like secular angels, maybe.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7.</h3>\r\n<p>When she moves away, she calls home sometimes, the way anyone does. She gets restless, though, and likes to wander when she\u2019s on the phone. This is a habit that annoys her mother, but now that they no longer live in the same house, her mother can\u2019t witness her reproachable habits. \u201cWhat are you walking?\u201d her mother will ask as she walks north, far past her apartment, past where her friends live. \u201cI\u2019m not walking anywhere.\u201d \u201cYes, you are. I can hear you breathe.\u201d Or, \u201cAre you going to the library?\u201d her mother will ask. The library is sometimes a place she goes, but also a place she has found makes for a good cover. \u201cNo, I\u2019m at home.\u201d She\u2019s just <i>walking,</i> not to anywhere, but she doesn\u2019t want the library to be used up as a destination. \u201cIs it warm there? Your windows must be open. I can hear the traffic.\u201d A single car breaks at the light on Forty-third Street.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8.</h3>\r\n<p>The rest of the world is busy moving out for the summer, for forever, throwing pillows out of third-floor windows to their boyfriends on the sidewalks below. A few months ago, when it became clear that her parents were coming to watch her graduate, her friends asked what she planned to do with them while they were in town. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know.\u201d She was thinking about class. But her Woolf seminar seemed unlikely to provide her with parent-friendly activity. \u201cMaybe I should host a panel discussion with them. Like, we\u2019ll all interview them on what it\u2019s like to be a grownup. You guys will have to come with questions prepared.\u201d She mentionsed this to her parents on the phone as a joke. \u201cDo you guys want to hold a panel when you come? Sort of like a roundtable? We could have wine and cheese and you can meet all my friends.\u201d Somehow, they fell for it. She alerts the troops.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe evening of the panel, her friends text excuses for tardiness. She leaves her parents in her living room and runs upstairs to bang on Peter\u2019s door. \u201cYo, hey, are you ready?\u201d \u201cOh, hi, is it time?\u201d Peter drinks from a glass. He\u2019s moving slowly, but she kind of can\u2019t blame him. It\u2019s June. The air is thick with tangible heat, but he\u2019s coming. \u201cDo you guys want ice coffee?\u201d she asks her parents, back downstairs. Her father takes her up on the offer. It\u2019s clear to her that he wants more to be accepting than  to cool down, but she makes them some anyway. Her mother calls out for a corkscrew. The girl spills some coffee, sloshes the ice back in the freezer, pulls the good corkscrew out of the drawer, slams it shut. She has to stage a riveting conversation with her parents so her friends can walk <i>in media res</i> and be fascinated by her parents\u2019 intellectual eccentricities. But she doesn\u2019t know how to time their conversation to seem most impressive when there are actually people there to hear it. She\u2019s already told her friends too many times about how her dad spent a night in jail once because he was cold and hitchhiking and the cops took pity on him, so she can\u2019t be perpetually on the brink of asking him for the details. But she did just drag them to a Bruce Naumann exhibit earlier that afternoon, a room filled with videos of clowns pissing while making loud nonsense sounds. None of them had liked it, but defending it now could be useful. \u201cCan\u2019t it count as art even if you didn\u2019t enjoy it?\u201d she pressures her parents. Where is Peter? Where is Anna? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe hands off the coffee and the corkscrew. \u201cLet\u2019s do the prosecco first, maybe?\u201d she suggests. Its price is twice what she normally spends on a bottle. She unwraps some brie. She sits on the windowsill, leans back, bounces up immediately.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cDad, wait, hey, do you want to help me move some chairs around? Like, we could have you and Mom sit here.\u201d She pushes metal chairs from the kitchen so their backs are to the window. \u201cGosh, kid, you have quite the vision here,\u201d her father tells her, enjoying the situation. Her mother hands her a glass, waiting to toast. The girl doesn\u2019t think they have time to toast. But it will make them think she\u2019s less stressed if she eases off on the orders. \u201cCongratulations, kid,\u201d her father says. But anyone can write passing papers for school. She wants to enable worthwhile conversations. Surely that\u2019s more meritorious, but it\u2019s not like anyone has come yet, so it doesn\u2019t yet count as an accomplishment or lack thereof. Their glasses collide, tingle. Peter comes in after knocking politely. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe gets a text from Oliver. Amanda\u2019s gerbil is dying, so he has to sit with her while she tries to resuscitate it. They can\u2019t come after all, but she should have fun. She flips her phone off but he texts again, will she be around next week? Next week takes place in a future she can\u2019t imagine. She\u2019s not going to deal with this now. Gerbils are disgusting animals, anyway.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe looks up. Peter and her parents are smiling at one another. \u201cI\u2019m Peter,\u201d Peter is saying. Thank god he has social graces, but he\u2019s taking her lines. \u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she says. \u201cPeter, these are my parents.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Lisa,\u201d her mother interrupts. \u201cPeter lives upstairs,\u201d the girl explains, as though that were unclear. She tries to think of a way to contextualize Peter. Mostly, he and she have been spending a lot of time drinking beer and eating self-congratulatory ice cream together to beat the June sweat. But she doesn\u2019t say this.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe wants to get mileage out of her defense of Bruce Naumann\u2019s merits, but the intercom is buzzing. Maggie and Cameron arrive, Cameron fumbling with a large potted palm. Oh, right. She promised to plant-sit for them. This is kind of funny. Cameron looks like a tree with legs. She directs him to the fire escape so he can ditch the tree. Maggie meanwhile is introducing herself to the girl's parents in her business-casual voice. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Maggie.\u201d The girl is still forgetting to step in to present people. Shit. \u201cMaggie is the one I was telling you about who wants to be a vet.\u201d Her dad is a vet. They can bond. The girl says, \u201cWell, we should sit down\u201d because it seems like the kind of thing middle-aged hosts say in movies, not that she wants to be a middle-aged host in a movie, but usually her friends figure out what to do at parties right away. Usually, parties don\u2019t have so many rules. Usually, the girl turns off the lights for parties, but this is not a normal event so she can\u2019t justify darkness with her standard claims for party atmosphere. And besides, it\u2019s practically the longest day of the year outside, so it\u2019s barely twilight anyway. Their only atmosphere will come from the dust permanently smeared across the windows.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHer mom pours more wine. \u201cDid you guys see that new Bruce Naumann installation in the Modern Wing?\u201d the girl asks the room. She\u2019s parading attempts at cool, but can\u2019t make herself stop. \u201cYou know, the one with all the clowns on screens?\u201d Maggie reaches for a paper towel to mop up spilled wine. \u201cWe just saw it. And we\u2019ve been arguing about whether it counts as art. And if it is, are other annoying videos art? What about \u2018Sesame Street\u2019?\u201d Clowns squeal unintelligibly there, too. To her, this seems like a logical connection. Peter asks her mother to slice him some baguette. The girl runs to the kitchen for a sharper knife. Making her parents seem cool to her friends is trickier than making her friends seem cool to one another. At any moment, she thinks, her parents might relate how the family dental hygienist compared her appearance to that of the Campbell Soup baby until she was fifteen. Or ask whether she still takes things too literally.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhen she gets back, Maggie is listing some syllabus for her father, who the girl can tell is about to burst into stories of CD4 cells in small mammals. Too bad about Amanda\u2019s gerbil, actually; they could all have commiserated. Peter asks her how she\u2019s doing. She smiles on the verge of a joke she\u2019s hoping will come once she opens her mouth.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere\u2019s some tittering on the sidewalk. Anna and Becky have run into Gabe. Anna\u2019s black dress is really elegant. Hugging her hello, the girl tells her she really likes it. \u201cOh, no, I just got back from my uncle\u2019s memorial service. I was worried I\u2019d be overdressed.\u201d Good thing she hadn\u2019t complimented her further.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nShe handles introductions herself this time. \u201cThese are Anna and Becky and Gabe,\u201d she tells her parents. Her parents have met Gabe before\u2014once they had dinner when her parents were visiting a year or two ago. Her dad had misquoted Tolstoy to him not knowing Gabe had spent the previous summer reading <i>Anna Karenina.</i> But Gabe had kindly not disclosed this to her father, who\u2019d thus been free to make since forgotten claims about happy families. So it\u2019s good that Gabe has shown, that they\u2019ve had this dinner together before. Now they can test her friend Lucy\u2019s theory that combining random people at a party can work well so long as everyone knows at least one or two other people. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nContemporary art seems less useful now that the room is filled, and this is a party with a purpose. \u201cThis is my mother, Lisa,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd this is my dad, Scott. Um. They got married in 1976. My mom\u2019s an accountant, and my dad\u2019s a vet.\u201d Her friends know these things. She prepped them in her email. And besides, her friends know everything there is to know about her. In fact, it is dangerous to combine all these people because, together, they can find out all there is to know about her. \u201cAnd then I was born about a decade later.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHer parents say hi. The girl looks around the room. She hopes that that look on Gabe\u2019s face is one of basking in the potential of such a weird setup. \u201cI guess I can start us off with a first question.\u201d The girl hasn\u2019t really done this part of the prep work she has tried to outsource to the masses. \u201cMaybe you guys can review for us what you did when you were first in the position of graduation, or of growing up, which are obviously potentially different things?\u201d she asks. It\u2019s kind of corny.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d her mom starts off. \u201cI knew I wanted to stay in Pittsburgh. I walked my resume all around town. I took a job as an assistant at a bank. I almost worked in the business end of a brewing company, but they were in a sketchier part of town and they were only paying about the same.\u201d \u201cI was already dating Lisa then,\u201d her dad says. \u201cIt was less competitive to become a vet back then, but I hadn\u2019t really been close to any of my professors in college, so there wasn\u2019t anyone to write me recs or anything.\u201d The girl has long been under the impression that her father had wanted to be a doctor for humans, but didn\u2019t think he could get into American med schools and didn\u2019t want to study in the Caribbean like his slacker friends had.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cSo I tried to apprentice myself to vets in the area . . .\u201d her dad is saying. This is not becoming a riveting story with an ending. She looks at Anna. Anna had replied to her invite with a link to an article on joint parenting. Anna sees her, asks how they split up household and family duties. Her mother explains, \u201cWell, it\u2019s a tough call. But if one person is cleaning up, then the other person is allowed to read the magazines, because the person cleaning up can\u2019t throw them away until the other one has finished reading them.\u201d This is pretty revelatory.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe girl can picture this going on in her parents\u2019 house\u2014her mom vacuuming, say, while her dad reads old newspapers or works on stuff brought home from work\u2014but isn\u2019t sure that she can actually remember it happening. The girl studies her guests again. Her mother has settled in more. That\u2019s good. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPeter asks how you know when you\u2019ve become a grownup. Subtly different from the girl\u2019s starter question about first becoming grownup. Her dad dates it to the first time he bought his mother dinner, sometime in college, he thinks it was. The girl feels highly aware that her parents have paid for the wine and cheese and crackers she and her friends are now consuming. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She gets up to see if there\u2019s anything else in the fridge and stops to pee before returning. Parties are always better if you don\u2019t think about them, right? Sitting on the toilet, she hears Gabe asks about the importance of understanding your spouse\u2019s job. When she comes back, Lucy has stopped by. She is introducing herself. The girl would like to say, Lucy is one of the most delightful friends I\u2019ve got. Lucy feeds me scrambled eggs and listens to me talk about my feelings. She would like to convey her love for Lucy without relating so many hours and cigarettes and stories. But she can\u2019t do that now. Lucy has to tend to her own visiting mother, but it was so lovely to meet Lisa and Scott. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nCameron and Maggie are really sorry, but they have to go, Maggie announces, standing up as the girl is sitting down again. Oh, no. That\u2019s too bad. She\u2019s so glad they came. How does one ever prevent grace from sounding false? Maggie goes on, yeah, she knows, she\u2019s sorry. It was good to meet her parents. Yes, even though conversation has now forgotten CD4 cells. Maggie waves goodbye. The girl\u2019s father gets up to shake their hands, which they offer uncertainly. Her mother waves from her chair. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBecky giggles silently on the couch next to a rosy Peter. The girl is pleased that her friends know to eat the rinds of their brie. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGabe and the girl\u2019s father discover they both like Faulkner. Her father remembers the coffin in <i>As I Lay Dying.</i> He always recalls novels in images, so the girl\u2019s bookish conversations with him center on trains being slow to arrive at stations and postmodern sewer scenes. The girl really likes the way an image can encapsulate, grow around, circumnavigate a whole, can render the inside of the whole null. Facts don\u2019t really matter.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBecky, who looks what the girl thinks must be glowing and wowed, has to leave, so Anna has to walk home with her, too, then. Gabe goes a few minutes later. Peter must have already left. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe girl swigs from a coffee cup of melted ice. \r\n</p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\u201c9/11 was an inside job! Why can't you understand that?\u201d barrels Alex Jones, an Austin-based radio host. He does not speak with the rising and falling intonations one would expect from an accomplished public speaker (his internet audience is larger than Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck combined.) He operates like a machine gun, his beer belly delivering exasperated volleys. \u201cThe globalists are organized, corrupt, a bunch of thieving parasites!\u201d His body is arched over, the microphone centimeters away from his teeth.  A deep breath and he lowers his volume. \u201cPeople are waking up, though, a lot of good things are happening, and so I should be more positive. It's just that I have trouble looking at Obama, and trouble looking at Bush, and looking at these local criminals. And looking at all the stuff they do. I'm sick of them. I have more than a hatred for them,\u201d he crescendos, \u201cI have a disgust, a disdain.\u201d He hangs onto the final syllable, leaving it in the air for a moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the topics covered are quite diverse: water fluoridation, the NATO operation in Libya, and Chairman Bernanke's decision to marginally increase the inflation target. His trademark is not to cover these topics as isolated stories. A mainstream news anchor transitions from one story to the next, perhaps with a cheeky pun. Jones does not. Each of these stories is a manifestation of a vast conspiracy to undermine American society. Hence, each show culminates in a final soliloquy; Jones makes the final connections that demonstrate the validity of the grand narrative conspiracy theory he has woven for his decade-long career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This piece concerns the sociological nature of conspiracy theories and their consequences for the governance of modern democratic societies. My fundamental operating assumption is that they are a particular problem for our public spheres and I thus advance the claim that their role in our political life has not been fully appreciated or understood. Too often they are dismissed as products of mere ignorance or as the beliefs of an isolated fringe. These woefully inadequate accounts misunderstand how conspiracy theories actually operate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should thus first divest ourselves of two perspectives that mischaracterize the nature of conspiracy theories. First, if one defines a conspiracy theory as simply a false belief that is widely held, our analysis is then refashioned as a question of epistemology and will perhaps quickly devolve into a question of semantics. One would commit to a particular standard or procedure for validating claims and then position conspiracy theories as an object within the larger set of beliefs that cannot meet this standard. An analysis of the social origins or consequences of these beliefs is completely absent. It is undoubtedly true that any given population of people will come to some conclusions that we may readily find to be empirically suspect.  Indeed, over the long arc of history, there is a rich and varied history of religious, metaphysical and \u201cscientific\u201d false beliefs.  If one shelves the conspiracy theories alongside these beliefs, the analysis does little to explicate their structure or the particular claim to knowledge that they represent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conspiracy theory is formed within a particular community of like-minded enthusiasts. It is more than just a hunch or an explanation of an isolated incident; often it is an elaborate narrative, one that specifies pivotal characters and motivations. The real question of interest is how individuals come to understand themselves as possessing that type of knowledge. In short, an analysis simply premised on empirical validity unduly restricts our vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, it should not be forgotten that some conspiracy theories have later turned out to be actually true. There was a conspiracy to bug a Watergate hotel room used by the Democratic National Committee, the CIA did administer drugs like LSD under Project MKULTRA to develop mind control techniques, there was an extensive conspiracy to provide weapons to Contra rebels through weapon sales to Iran, a plan called Operation Northwoods was discussed by high-level Department of Defense officials to simulate acts of domestic terrorism as a pretext for a conflict with Cuba, and it is a matter of historical dispute whether the North Vietnamese were unambiguously aggressive during the Gulf of Tonkin incident that set off the Vietnam War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another misconception is that conspiracy theories are found only on the fringe, and should perhaps be distinguished by their absence from the political mainstream. This account fails to comprehend how popular a number of conspiracy theories are\u2014a 2004 poll found that 49% of New York City residents believed that the government \u201cknew in advance that attacks were planned on or around September 11, 2001, and that they consciously failed to act.\u201d The widespread nature of conspiracy theories surrounding Barack Obama's birth certificate and religious faith has also been well documented. At birtherism\u2019s peak, just under a quarter of Iowa Republicans\u2014voters who play a pivotal role during the presidential primaries\u2014believed that Barack Obama was definitely born in Hawaii. Or consider how quickly the \u201cdeath panels\u201d theory spread in reaction to the Democrats\u2019 proposed healthcare bill in 2009. This is not to suggest that a majority, or even a plurality, of Americans cling to demonstrably false and fantastic beliefs, but it does suggest that conspiracy theories are by no means the province of a completely isolated fringe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conspiracy theories can thus not be defined either by their substance, nor by their adherents. Instead, there are several critical features of their structure which form the basis of my analysis. One, conspiracy theories are self-perpetuating; two, they are developed by amateur researchers within a particular community; three, they are entirely grounded in empirical events; and four, they are agentive accounts of social forces. Each of these facets works in tandem to define the particular way in which conspiracy theories organize the world. This is an account of the architecture or the style of the conspiratorial imagination\u2014substance is secondary to structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conspiracy theories are self-perpetuating in the sense that contrary evidence or condemnation by authorities works more like gasoline than water. Suppose one believes that water fluoridation is part of a plot to brainwash the American public. If the Center for Disease Control publishes a peer-reviewed article arguing that fluoridation improves dental hygiene and lowers long-term health costs, it is unlikely this would lead to a moment of critical reflection. Rather, it confirms the insights of the original claim. Not only is the government controlling the drinking water; it is now creating propaganda to the contrary. New evidence is folded into the original claims and in turn, the conspiracy theory becomes more robust. The domain of the theory expands as additional features of the world become apparent: the government lies or works to control the population. The breadth of topics that Jones covers is stunning, but each new data point is always oriented toward the same set of unfalsifiable presuppositions. </p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe width=\"425\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/cPy8SnzRsqc?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p>This dismissal of authority through self-reinforcement leads to a second feature of conspiracy theories: the need for amateur researchers to reveal the \u201ctrue\u201d story. Although Jones largely marshals evidence from traditional authoritative institutions, like government agencies, media outlets, and research universities, it is in the interpretation that he adds his special touch.  He is the lone voice that has discovered the connections between these disconnected stories. The result is a whirlwind of facts and figures, thrown forth with the gusto of a fire-and-brimstone preacher. Rhetorically impressive, but even a slight cut of critical thinking dismantles the argument. Jones begins each show with a mundane roundup of the day\u2019s events, but every few sentences he is quick to extrapolate to absurdity. A story buried in the back of a small town newspaper concerning a local bureaucrat issuing a warning about a particular pesticide is used to signify a range of new chemical controls emanating from a mysterious Washington elite, but it does not stop there, as Jones will leap from the Washington bureaucrats to the omnipotent financial elites who are <i>really</i> controlling things.  All that is mundane is realized on a grander scale, but always along a single path of analysis: one that seeks to define an agent that stands to benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is another closely connected feature of conspiracy theories to highlight: the object of analysis is always concrete empirical facts. Luke Rudkowski, a New York City-based 9/11 Truther documentarian, when asked whether he was a conspiracy theorist on Russian state television, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSKuMmyHdLg\">responded</a>, \u201cThere's nothing theoretical in what we talk about. We have sources, we have documents... People call us conspiracy theorists because it's a bad name, a dirty word. I don't theorize on anything. I'm not a theorist. But they say I do because they want to make believe what I'm doing is fake, and all the real issues I'm covering are not truth, but they are truth.\u201d Conspiracy theories are fundamentally narratives of actual events. They are a way of making sense of the empirical world. John F. Kennedy was shot, the World Trade Center did collapse, and the government does fluoridate our drinking water, but it is the interpretation of these events through the conspiratorial lens that gives them that distinctive flavor that only be found by adding a tinge of a tin hat. Conspiracy theorists are best characterized not as factually incorrect, but merely social-theoretically impoverished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final defining feature of conspiracy theories is that they are a purely agentive account of social life. Where a social scientist sees structure, the conspiracy theorist sees an agent. Who that agent may be is determined by an analysis of \u201ccui bono?\u201d This analysis begins with the drastic event (the 9/11 terrorist attacks, say, or the assassination of a political figure) and then proceeds to look backwards. The conspiracy theorist extrapolates that an entity that benefited from a given event must be the cause of it happening. This amounts to an anthropomorphization of social forces. Hence, personalities must be assigned, motives become central, and Manichean moral conflicts arise. What a conspiracy theory does is reduce complexity and abstract forces to a comprehensible soap opera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jones' analysis typifies the purely agentive account of the world that conspiracy theorists operate with. In <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1070329053600562261\"><i>Endgame: Blueprint for Global Enslavement</i></a>, Jones' two-hour magnum opus documentary on the New World Order, the viewer is treated to a history of international war spanning almost a half a millennium. War, for Jones, has always been engineered by the victors. In his exceptionally vulgar materialism, Jones makes no claim to know the process, only the actor responsible. To advance these claims, his rhetorical strategy is twofold. He first makes an appeal to the common-sense presupposition that agents typically act in their own interest. Then he traces an empirical set of connections to a given agent that caused a given event to happen, one that will soon engineer drastic and deplorable changes in our contemporary society. For example, the first substantial argument of Endgame is that international financiers provided loans to various governments in order to wage wars. Jones then advances the marginally true empirically true claim that members of the extended Rothschild family were members of this early financial elite. He draws a line from this historical fact to the contemporary one that the Rothschild family continues to have large financial holdings. The Rothschilds thus engineer foreign wars. <i>Q.E.D.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These final two features of conspiracy theories\u2014their focus on empirical events and their post-hoc agentive accounts of these events\u2014explains why conspiracy theorists have little interest in the process through which these supposed elites exercise their power. These events have happened, \u201cthose Towers fell down,\u201d Jones will consistently declare; the real question is who. How this power has manifested itself is less important than identifying the culprit. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only does the conspiracy theorist's focus on the isolated events lead to outlandishly powerful agents, but the concealed nature of the imagined beneficiaries simultaneously pushes the question of the means of their power further to the side. The intention becomes all-consuming for the conspiracy theorist; it is the key to unraveling the accompanying plots. We thus find in Alex Jones' 2009 documentary, The Obama Deception, a catalog of government wrongdoing: false flag pretexts for wars, camps set up by FEMA to house dissidents, financial panics engineered by international bankers, and chemicals in our water supply and food, which will of course be used as part of the upcoming massive brainwashing scheme. These various disconnected strands are laying the foundation for the New World Order. He characterized the post-NWO world as follows in an interview with journalist Jonathan Kay: \u201cBottom line, the future as I see it is this: 70% <i>Brave New World</i>, 30% <i>Nineteen-Eighty-Four</i>. There'll be lots of video games, drugs, Soma, Prozac, parties\u2014but if you get out of line, the SWAT team's coming.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jones' work, which has spanned almost two decades, resembles a snowball descending a steep hill. Each new piece of information fits into the preexisting narrative. The conspiratorial imagination does not see a world of disconnected accidents, quirks of bureaucratic mismanagement, and the perverse consequences of varied institutional incentives. He sees agency and intentionality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The origins of beliefs in conspiracy theories is our final unanswered question. As I argued earlier, attributing conspiracy theories to a given social class or popular ignorance does not sufficiently explain their sociological nature. These theories have a degree of plausibility because powerful actors do affect the world and occasionally these agents take credit for certain changes. Politicians frequently celebrate the prosperity they have created or deride their opponents for failing to do so. There are indeed powerful economic entities, although not necessarily specific individuals or families, and the behavior of these decision makers has real consequences for the social landscape of the United States. Ultimately what conspiracy theories do is engage in a radical reductivism which reconceptualizes social forces as individuals and renders those forces invisible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A conspiracy theory can thus have salient features that resemble legitimate political slogans. Locating blame and taking credit for political events is the bread and butter of political campaigns. However, there is a clear difference: where the conspiracy theory thrives is in the simplicity with which it links powerful interests to objectively unfortunate events. In the political arena, one finds multiple competing narratives, each with its specific protagonists. The sound bite does not have the scale of a conspiracy theory\u2014it does not endeavor to moralize the mundane consequences of complex and interconnected institutions and give life to a world that is often chaotic, random, and unintended. Conspiracy theories\u2019 potency is found in their mechanisms which self-perpetuate, insulate their believers from authoritative accounts, and privilege agentive accounts. Taken together, these features work to insulate this paranoid style from critical reflection. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two main consequences of conspiracy theories for the open society. The first is horrific displays of violence. The conspiracy theorist is obsessed with the high stakes that the whole of society faces, convinced in his increasing isolation he is one of a select few who have connected the dots to understand this total truth. The justifications claimed by Timothy McVeigh, Ted Kaczynski, and Anders Breivik trade in the exact same forms of conspiracy theory that are Jones' bread and butter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second consequence is far more subtle and far more poignant. The particular architecture of conspiracy theories has significant consequences for the governance of democratic societies. We are confronted here by a social form that is safe-guarded by our most prized liberal values\u2014the rights to free speech and free association\u2014but their very structure also works to undermine those same values. Conspiracy theories cut short the exchange of critical values that become is the hallmark of the public sphere. They are thus parasitic on the very institutions that protect them, and through their self-perpetuation, they operate as a continuously expanding tumor, a cancer that cannot be easily cut from the body politic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The insulation of conspiracy theories from critical reflection is all the more apparent when one considers the extremes that some thinkers go to combat these theories. Cass Sunstein endorses the view that \u201cgovernment should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories.\u201d He argues that allowing conspiracy theories to fester is unacceptable and that state intervention is necessary. He quotes Philip Zelikow, the executive director of the 9/11 Comission: \u201cThe hardcore conspiracy theorists are totally committed. They'd have to repudiate much of their life identity in order not to accept some of that stuff. That's not our worry. Our worry is when things become infectious...this stuff can be deeply corrosive to public understanding.\u201d This is an insufficient response for Sunstein, as it both takes the hardcore contingent as a given and fails to recognize that the same contingent might be the most dangerous. He thus raises the possibility of government agents, acting anonymously, entering online social networks or attending organization meetings in an attempt to present diverse points of view. In short, their role would be to undermine the self-perpetuating nature of conspiracy theories. He argues that if these agents identified themselves as government agents, they would not likely gain traction in conspiracy theory circles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such an approach is a sharp blow to our liberal sensibilities. Government intervention that aims to alter political speech is a risky road to take. Yet the epistemological structure of conspiracy theories leaves little space for remedies typically found within liberal democratic spheres. These theories are weeds which thrive in the fertile soil of our most basic liberties. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>The most titillating party games are confessional. \u201cKill/Fuck/Marry\u201d is cynically so\u2014if not shameless, at least ungodfearing. Nobody is punished in that game. Punishment anticipated is rerouted back into a confession of violence. \u201cTruth or Dare?\u201d punishes players for keeping secrets. Its special charm lies in the fact that these punishments always threaten to reveal too much about their authors... and, even more, that they are simultaneously the enacted fantasies of the player who wouldn\u2019t confess them. In either game, of course, players may lie. This lie is already factored elegantly into the calculus of \u201cTruth or Dare?\u201d: the liar is sentenced to exhaustion by compulsory further lying, or else to revelatory punishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas \u201cTwo Truths and a Lie\u201d is formally inspired by the actual best technique of lying. One confesses twice and lies once. However, since all parties are forewarned, the participant isn\u2019t lying at all. In \u201cTwo Truths and a Lie,\u201d there isn\u2019t any lying, and there isn\u2019t any punishment. There is silence about the falsehood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why \u201cLies,\u201d today? Partly because, as recently as the 19th century, lies, masks, and deliberate omissions were considered integral to philosophy. Most infamously, these devices characterize Nietzsche, who was decisive in shaping the 20th century\u2019s spiritual intimations. Forgive the heady digression\u2014or skip ahead, to where the illustrations begin. Here\u2019s the trouble: intimations aren\u2019t enough for modern philosophy. To make anything out of these intimations, modern philosophy has to, as Benjamin wrote in \u201cThe Coming Philosophy\u201d (1918), \u201cturn them into knowledge.\u201d But the modern ideal of knowledge has another source than Nietzsche, one whose structure forbids masks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To present this ideal, I\u2019ll sketch three characteristics of modern philosophical investigation: 1) Clarification has become a central commitment of philosophy. Statements are evaluated for their degree of clarity or confusion. 2) A critique of presuppositions, inherited from the Enlightenment, remains. Statements are parsed for presuppositions. But in the spirit of formalism, even logical systems (or more importantly, the ability of a logical system to be meaningful) are understood to have presuppositions. Certain presuppositions are understood to be necessary \u201cconditions of possibility.\u201d 3) Since skepticism, philosophy has remained extremely reflexive. All questions are questioned, primarily in terms of the above two axes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These three commitments are tightly interconnected. Philosophy must clarify, reflexively, its own terminology as much as foreign terminologies; it must be as clear as possible about its presuppositions, and not allow these to sink back into undifferentiated habits of living. Philosophy must inquire into the presuppositions of its questions, and not simply into their clarity; it must also inquire into the presuppositions of its ability to distinguish clarity from confusion. Philosophy reaches a climax at the point where it most reflexively attempts to clarify the idea of clarity, and to ask about the presuppositions of the idea of presupposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These characteristics also clash. Reflexivity can bring philosophy to a point where it cannot justify its own presuppositions or clarify its terminology. And the hunt for presuppositions can require philosophy to explicitly presuppose something it isn\u2019t fully able to explain or comprehend. Therefore, the ideal of knowledge in modern philosophy is: 1) maximum clarity; but if questioning must presuppose something it is unable to clarify, this ideal is replaced with: maximum explicitness about clarity and confusion; 2) constant struggle and experimentation with presuppositions, which must always be as explicit as possible; 3) maximum reflexivity, such that all questioning brings with it its own clarity and a dossier of the conditions of possibility of this clarity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern philosophy cannot afford any ambiguity as to whether it has lived up to this threefold ideal. A philosopher who omits self-criticism, who feigns presuppositionlessness, or who fudges when his understanding ends? A sloppy philosopher. But since the climactic point of philosophy lies only in the direction of maximum reflexivity, maximum explicitness about confusion, and maximum engagement with presupposition, philosophy is, apparently, incapable of silence or masks. Whether it can lie\u2014on this point, I have much to be silent about. Oh, who am I kidding? But cf. Daniel Mizrahi\u2019s <a href=\"http://hypocritereader.com/7/lies-and-method\">article</a>, if you can muckle it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Esotericism in textual interpretation is a game of \u201c...and a Lie.\u201d What separates the exoteric audience from the initiated, more than whatever special decoding practice the initiated may wield, more than their discipline and patience, is that the others are being lied to, but the initiated are forewarned. The text they read is silent about falsehood. This is not possible for modern philosophy; which raises questions about its relation to the modern spiritual project. The attempt to reconcile Nietzschean masks with Kantian, Heideggerian, or Wittgensteinian clarification takes its weakest possible form in lust for mystery. In such mystery, <i>something</i> is playing \u201cTwo Truths,\u201d but it\u2019s not the philosophers. This is our sluggish contemporary occultism: a grinning mask, one that nobody would ever wear, on display.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s this same mask that hangs on every panel of Jim Woodring\u2019s graphic novels. His strange animals often appear to be constructed of beveled wood. The proximity of upholstery exaggerates this bourgeois nightmarishness, a little like the Second Empire furnishings in No Exit. His idols are a hotel room talking.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/media/images/7/upholstry.jpg\"><img src=\"/media/images/7/upholstry_detail.jpg\" ></center>\r\n\r\n<p>Their eyes are painted on, or they don\u2019t have eyes. They\u2019re painted looking to the left, suspiciously. Pigmentations that loosely hang as eyes and a mouth, in the fashion of animal mimicry. There are also plants that look like faces. Curtains and wallpapers of open eyes. Arrays of spots on the pelts of things.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/media/images/7/passerby.jpg\" class=\"picture\"></center>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there are smiling beasts. This one is short, which means he\u2019s probably not in charge of anything. Since we\u2019re in some kind of palace, it can be assumed that he\u2019s some kind of guard or guide. He\u2019s in a doorway.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/media/images/7/dog.jpg\" class=\"picture\"></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are no evil intentions, just evil moods of everything. Nonetheless, this single divine force chooses to torture its clientele through grinning lower deities, not by natural disaster or disease. Why does the work of one God bear multiple and strange <i>faces</i>? It is fortunate for monotheism that, in our universe, it does not. (Angels being one dangerous exception.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The animals in Jim Woodring are so ambiguous because his universe, in all its seeming agents, pursues its own agenda. Allison Howe, this issue, initiates us into just such a universe of duplicity and determinism. Her short piece on reality TV production evokes one of Thomas Pynchon\u2019s proverbs for paranoids: \u201cYou may never get to touch the Master, but you can tickle his creatures.\u201d Allison is one of these creatures, but today she does the tickling. <a href=\"http://hypocritereader.com/7/thoughts-about-santa-while-working-on-reality-tv\">Her expos\u00e9</a> is a meditation on the lust for mendacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another article addresses the concept of idolatry. Over beers with its author, I and another contributor, Ilya Schwartzburg, discovered that I had always associated idolatry with decadence and lust. I wasn\u2019t alone in this error. From Cecil B. DeMille\u2019s <i>The Ten Commandments</i>:</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe width=\"425\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lTD1586dDzY?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p>Drinking, dancing, chaos, carnality, violence (up to, in this strange clip, rape) among the idolaters! This is idolatry filtered through a Puritan fantasy of evil. But this fantasy is rigged towards contrition. If anything, sinners become exaggeratedly monotheistic. Such idolatry remains within the Christian dialectic of trespass and absolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this bar in Berkeley, Avi Garelick, who\u2019s the one writing on idols, hypothesized that the derision of idols in the Old Testament intentionally misunderstood idolatry. We paused and attempted, for the first time, to imagine idolatry. Then Ilya said: Well, it is particularly difficult to accept that evil and good are the work of one God. Avi said: The crime is to \u201cbow down and worship\u201d; fundamentally an issue of social deterioration. I said: \u201cFearing\u201d is almost a synonym for worship. OCD and modern anxiety disorders provide another example of fear\u2019s relation to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_(religious_practice)\">cult</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we realized that fear, more than desire, compels idolatry. Avi then cited the idolatrous women in <i>Jeremiah</i>: \u201cAs for the word that you have spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we are not going to listen to you. [...] From the time we stopped making offerings to the queen of heaven and pouring out libations to her, we have lacked everything and have perished by the sword and by famine.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But one motif in the polemic against idolatry has had special ramifications for the last thousand years: that the idol is man-made. Worshipping the work of your own hands! What fools! But the work of your own hands is what you fear the most:</p>\r\n\r\n<center><iframe width=\"425\" height=\"349\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/YEdZh8a4ZvE?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\r\n\r\n<p>And what pagan God isn\u2019t terrorized by his offspring? Meanwhile, under the influence of Philosophy, the artificiality of the idol is compared to the finitude of human conceiving. Our understanding \u201cmakes\u201d concepts of God; to avoid worshipping an \u201cidol,\u201d then, it has to be careful to abstract from what it understands of what it worships. A war on sensuousness ultimately condemns most worshippers as idolaters. But suddenly the issue becomes the claim of reason over the object of worship, where originally all that mattered was to respect God\u2019s omnipotence; at first the derision of \u201cman-made\u201d idols was loosely equivalent to a modern parent\u2019s self-righteous dismissal of neurosis: \u201cIt\u2019s between your ears.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avi, whose article was, at this writing, still in breakneck composition, will discuss the rich debate on anthropomorphism and idolatry within Judaism that followed Maimonides\u2019s unprecedented philosophical imposition on worship. <a href=\"http://hypocritereader.com/7/god-for-the-perplexed\">Read it here.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I initially asked Avi to write about idolatry out of philosophical concerns for which I have now been duly chastised. My thought was that the concept of idolatry seemed to imply that we can learn how to approach God by way of epistemology. It seemed to be a matter of understanding precisely what right our understanding had to extend its concepts onto God. In that case there might be a philosophical method to worship: a technique of access to God, or at least of knowing where one stands with respect to such access. If Avi\u2019s critique weren\u2019t enough, Daniel Mizrahi\u2019s surprise submission, <a href=\"http://hypocritereader.com/7/lies-and-method\">\u201cLies and Method,\u201d</a> has taken me to task for my naive and stunting conception of method, which foreclosed appreciation of method\u2019s driving tensions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conspiracy theorists, whom Zach Wehrwein analyzes with subtlety, are themselves a kind of anti-idolater: they refuse to recognize the power of man-made idols and structures. An agent must be directly responsible. <a href=\"http://hypocritereader.com/7/the-architecture-of-conspiracy-theories\">Mr. Wehrwein outlines this paranoid historicism,</a> which generalizes the idea of the government cover-up. <a href=\"http://hypocritereader.com/7/the-only-good-elephant\">Cat Pierro\u2019s delightful fable</a> presents another generalization of the lie: the disastrous universality of dishonesty achieved by worn-out multiple confession. Such entangled reflexivity is frequently striking in the fiction of David Foster Wallace, on whom one contributor has just abandoned a short essay. Pierro\u2019s piece itself begins from a scene from <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, one of the most famous examples in our culture of \u201ccalling out.\u201d For more on \u201ccalling out,\u201d check out Courtney Chatellier\u2019s historical and metaphysical exploration of its ancestor, only freshly forgotten: <a href=\"http://hypocritereader.com/7/on-giving-the-lie\">\u201cOn Giving the Lie.\u201d</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For dessert, we have creative nonfiction from two infamous liars.

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nI recently moved myself and an excess of worldly goods 1000 miles cross country.  The whole affair went about as well as could be hoped for\u2013that is to say, Budget Rental's computer system crashed nationally the morning of my truck rental, the city posted my parking permits in front of the wrong building, my gas tank would not accept gas from any station in the whole state of New York, and the last hundred and fifty miles of the trip meandered through a series of severe weather warnings.  Tornadoes, naturally.  When all my things were finally in my new apartment and that miserable truck was gone, I collapsed with a beer and turned on some music.  Some music to relax to; something to calm my spirits and perhaps revive them.  There was a lot of unpacking left to do, after all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI picked Billie Holiday.   I picked her in part because I so love her music, and in part because I have somehow collected 139 of her songs, and I knew it would be a good long while before I would have to get out of my chair again and choose another artist.  The music began: a jaunty piano and a trumpet, beautifully muted, played a familiar melody.  Soon Holiday took over the theme from the trumpet.  At first I listened to her voice just as a sound, not minding the sense of her words.  She sang with lovely open vowels, her voice vibrating lightly, drawing out her lyrics just behind the beat of the music.  She sounded languid, almost drowsy. I pictured her singing the way I\u2019d seen her in so many photographs, with her eyes half-closed and her face lifted up to the sky.  To hell with moving trucks, parking permits, and tornados, I thought.  Here is some real peace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAfter a few bars, my attention settled on the lyrics of the song.  I\u2019d known the melody at once: it was an old Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein standard, <a href = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAXbkqKiyf8>\u201cWhy Was I Born?\u201d</a>.  Holiday was singing the second verse now:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nWhy do I try<br />\r\nTo draw you near me?<br />\r\nWhy do I cry?<br />\r\nYou never hear me.<br />\r\nI'm a poor fool but what can I do?<br />\r\nOh baby,<br />\r\nWhy was I born to love you?<br />\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nAs I listened, my picture of Holiday changed, a small detail but an important one.  Now, instead of closing her eyes in drowsy peace, she was screwing them up in pain.  I liked the other picture better; complaints of unrequited love are not very restful.  I\u2019ve had enough of poor fools for today, I thought.  God knows I\u2019m not really in the mood for more.  (It is a well-known fact that the stress of moving makes <i>some</i> people unbecomingly pettish.)  Fortunately the song was drawing to a close, and a new one soon began.  It was <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud8_CcFYcQ8>\u201cMy Man\u201d</a>, one of Holiday\u2019s early hits.  The rhythm section opened with an insouciant swing (that\u2019s more like it!), and Holiday began to croon.  I hummed along, and when Holiday came to the chorus, I chimed in:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nOh my man, I love him so,<br />\r\nHe\u2019ll never know.<br />\r\nAll my life is just despair,<br />\r\nBut I don\u2019t care.<br />\r\nWhen he takes me in his arms,<br />\r\nThe world is bright,<br />\r\nAll right.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat's the difference if I say<br />\r\nI'll go away,<br />\r\nWhen I know I'll come back<br />\r\nOn my knees someday?<br />\r\nFor whatever my man is,<br />\r\nI'm his forevermore.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo much for peace.  \u201cAll my life is just despair, but I don\u2019t care\u201d is not a sentiment that soothes, and it is worse when you sing it yourself.  I had heard the line a hundred times before, but this time the combination of lyrics and music seemed almost macabre to me.  Is this what it is supposed to sound like, crawling back to your callous lover on your knees?  And what is with that strange, bow-wowing trumpet at the end of the song, as if we were in a raunchy burlesque?  If we are going to make music out of such despair, couldn\u2019t we at least have the decency to do it in a cabaret? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe rest of the hour went on as it had begun.  The iTunes shuffle feature, to which I had naively entrusted the music, bounced through just about every song of heartbreak and longing in my Holiday library with perverse accuracy.  The music was sometimes bright and sunny, sometimes slow and mellow, but beneath the sound beat a sad, starving heart.  Why did I not notice that before? I wondered.  I know the words to all these songs\u2013have I really never considered what they mean?  And what am I to make of them now?\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n*** \r\n</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBillie Holiday made some strange music out of heartbreak.  There is a corner of her work\u2013not the whole catalogue, mind you, but a pronounced group of recordings\u2013which make what I will lamely call \u201cpleasant\u201d music out of a deeply distressed experience of love.<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup>\r\n  Love in these songs is not a joyful or fulfilled sensation, but a kind of perpetual, dismal hunger.  Love is always craving the beloved, with every bit of your energy and will.  \u201cAll of me, why not take all of me?\u201d Holiday moans in <a href = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P0hG3sD0-E >one song </a>.  \u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m no good without you?\u201d  Her longing is irrepressible, practically a natural imperative (\u201c<a href = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4cqrZs4iJ8>Fish got to swim</a> and birds got to fly/I got to love one man till I die\u201d) , and it commands her whole being\u2013<a href = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npoe5XeeMYE>\u201cBody and Soul,\u201d </a> to borrow one song\u2019s title.  Alas, the craving is never satisfied, that being the nature of hunger.  Instead the unfortunate lover is kept in a state of continual privation, looking for something good from his beloved but never getting it.  In <a href =http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVS8_vOkJNU >\u201cBillie\u2019s Blues\u201d </a> which Holiday wrote, she riffs magnificently on this sort of denial, playing between the hungering heart and the hungering stomach: \u201cMy man wouldn\u2019t give me no breakfast/Wouldn\u2019t give me no dinner/Squawked about my supper, then he put me outdoors!\u201d  Most lyrics aren\u2019t so clever (Holiday was a wickedly smart songwriter), but they get the point across.  Love a wretch, and you should expect to be left wanting.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\nAnd yet reciprocity isn\u2019t really the point in these songs.  The point is to want another person so much that they supply all your reason for living, your happiness and unhappiness, until it almost doesn\u2019t matter how well you are loved in return.  \u201cYou are my joy and my pain,\u201d Holiday sings to her cheating lover in <a href = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noSDr0er-kM>\u201cDon\u2019t Explain\u201d</a>, which she also co-wrote.  \u201cMy life\u2013yours, love.  Don\u2019t explain.\u201d<sup><a name=\"id2\" href=\"#ft2\">2</a></sup>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis sentiment\u2013my life is yours, love\u2013animates one of my favorite songs, \u201cMoanin\u2019 Low.\u201d  I originally heard \u201cMoanin\u2019 Low\u201d in the movie <i>Key Largo</i>, a film noir from 1948.  Claire Trevor\u2019s <a href = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vh8veUgPt8>rendition</a> of the song as a washed-up, alcoholic singer is supposed to have won her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.  In that scene, Trevor\u2019s psychopathic lover forces her to sing one of the songs from her old lounge act in exchange for a drink.  Trevor sings without accompaniment.  False confidence gets her through the first few bars, but her control\u2013of the song, of herself\u2013soon disintegrates, and the performance descends into a pathetic spectacle.  Her life, such as it is, is plainly not her own; it belongs entirely to her awful lover, and to alcohol.  Two different sorts of cravings, with a multiplicative effect.  There is an obvious parallel between the song and its singer, and the whole scene evokes a strong feeling of pity in the viewers for both.  What a terrible state to be in, we think.  What utterly impossible conditions for living.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/8/salute.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustrations by Claire Bidwell</i></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBillie Holiday recorded \u201cMoanin\u2019 Low\u201d several times, the first almost a decade before Trevor\u2019s tour de force.  The recording session took place on March 31, 1937, a month after Holiday had learned that her father was dead.  Clarence Holiday had also been a musician, a guitarist and banjo player, but he had never been much of a father.  Billie was born when he was only 15 and her mother 13, and Holiday, Sr. skipped out soon after.  When Billie was picking a stage name as a teenager she laid claim to Clarence\u2019s paternity again, choosing his name to replace her birth name from her mother, Fagan.  She plucked the name Billie from one of her favorite actresses; her birth name was Eleanora.  Holiday\u2019s nightmarish journey from Eleanora Fagan to Billie Holiday has been well-documented elsewhere\u2013poverty, sex abuse and prostitution, stints in a reform school and in jail.  If anyone could draw out the harrowing tones of \u201cMoanin\u2019 Low,\u201d it was Billie Holiday.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the March 31st session, Holiday and her musicians recorded three songs.  The first was \u201cCarelessly,\u201d a \u201cnice melody,\u201d as one of Holiday\u2019s discographers graciously put it, about regrets in love.<sup><a name=\"id3\" href=\"#ft3\">3</a></sup>\r\nThe second was \u201cHow Could You,\u201d a lover\u2019s recrimination done up in silly strokes.  \u201cLove is just like apple pie, it\u2019s either sweet or tart/You could be the apple of my eye/But you, you, you upset the apple cart\u201d\u2014my bid for worst lyrics in a love song. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe third song Holiday et al. recorded was <a href = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikkj9TTCoFo>\u201cMoanin\u2019 Low\u201d</a>.  The song opens in a slow swing, with the piano and alto saxophone trading the theme back and forth across an extended introduction.  The saxophone does really seem to moan at times; it gives the theme a bluesy, plaintive sound without being too dramatic.  The piano sounds sparkling to me, offsetting the saxophone\u2019s lament.  The whole effect is reflective but understated.  When Holiday begins to sing, it is with an openness and trueness that no other jazz singer matches.  And yet, like the musicians with whom she plays, she sings with a certain restraint.  She rephrases the original melody down in lower notes sometimes, delaying climactic high notes or eliminating the ascent to climax altogether.  She sings:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nMoanin' low, my sweet man, I love him so,<br />\r\nThough he's mean as can be.<br />\r\nHe's the kind of man needs the kind<br />\r\nOf a woman like me.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Gonna die if my sweet man should pass me by.<br />\r\nIf I die where'll he be?<br />\r\nHe's the kind of a man needs the kind<br />\r\nOf a woman like me.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn Claire Travor\u2019s mouth, these lyrics were piteous, almost nauseating.  The desperation of the singer, her utter abasement and self-abnegation (\u201cIf I die where\u2019ll <i>he</i> be\u201d ?!) were unbearable.  Indeed, the characters who watch the performance in the movie look like they would rather be anywhere but in Trevor\u2019s audience.   Holiday\u2019s performance, by contrast, is intensely pleasurable.  Her voice is warm and expressive, and it aches in a kind of way that makes you want to ache, too.  But the ache never overpowers the music.  The piano does not descend into baleful chords, the saxophone doesn\u2019t mope or wail, and Holiday never, ever loses control. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat is the point of putting a song like \u201cMoanin\u2019 Low\u201d in these restraints?  The song has an explosive center; why diffuse it, why make it such a mellow pleasure?  Why record it alongside \u201cnice melodies\u201d like \u201cCarelessly\u201d and \u201cHow Could You\u201d?  Those songs are chirpers.  And then why listen to this song with your head resting against the back of a chair, your eyes closed, a cool drink in your hand and the breeze blowing through an open window over your face?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cMoanin\u2019 Low,\u201d like so many of the other songs I listened to in that chair, makes the hunger of the heart out to be something so dire, so absorbing, that it must stop us in our tracks and make us weep.  That is what Claire Trevor\u2019s performance expresses.  But Trevor had to sing \u201cMoanin\u2019 Low\u201d only once.  The first time around with that song, its anguish is new and raw, and terribly potent.  When Trevor\u2019s wrecked voice sings, \u201cGonna die if my sweet man should pass me by,\u201d and it seems possible that her love and grief might really kill her.  But Billie Holiday sang those words a hundred times, for a hundred different audiences.  And she sang dozens more songs about the same thing, over and over again, in the studio, on the stage, probably sometimes by herself just walking down the street.  When Holiday sings that lyric, \u201cGonna die,\u201d you know she is not going to die for love.  She is going to sing another song about it.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBillie Holiday and the musicians with whom she played rescue us from the beliefs about love played out in Trevor\u2019s performance of \u201cMoanin\u2019 Low.\u201d  In Holiday\u2019s recording, heartbreak and longing are still potent, but they are no longer dire.  Perhaps when someone sings a song like \u201cMoanin\u2019 Low\u201d so many times, the feeling of the song changes; it is no longer a singular cry of pain, as it was for Trevor, but a standard.  It is no longer about a catastrophe (\u201cGonna die!\u201d), but about a kind of chronic pain.  Holiday knew about cravings as well as anyone, but she must have known, too, about their inescapable dailiness, about the quotidian nature of all joy and pain, even in love.  In the songs she wrote, pangs of the heart are always grounded by a sharp eye for the mundane: what we are wearing, what we are holding in our hands, what we actually said to one another when we were fighting.  Who else would write a song about a mean lover that contains an entire verse describing his unusual pants (\u201cHe wears high trimmed pants/Stripes are really yellow/But when he starts in to love me/He is so <a href = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtgUbJN8oPE>fine and mellow</a>\u201d?  Who else would use plumbing as a metaphor for unrequited love (\u201cLove is just like a faucet/It turns on and off\u201d)?  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis ruthless awareness of our ordinary lives is, for me at least, a great insight from Holiday\u2019s music.  There is no better time to listen to these songs, than when we are relaxing in the breeze; when we are unpacking our kitchens; when we are wrestling our poorly-made furniture with the wrong size screwdriver.  We all have terrible, big feelings sometimes, of hunger and of love, but these feelings come to us and stay with us in the confines of our real and daily lives.  What then is the point of exploding the center of a sad song?  That is an only an outburst.  You may go to bed sobbing like Claire Trevor, cast away over the bar at the end of her song; but you will wake up like Billie Holiday, unhappy but not really surprised to find that the sun that set over your heart the night before is rising above it again this morning.   This is in fact the condition of your life.  So sing along with Holiday: \u201cGood morning heartache, here we go again.\u201d\r\n\r\n<p> <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/rk1IKHd_0fk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\">\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nSome of the best songs from this group I mention in the text of the article, but I did not have occasion to include a few others.

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nIn the most desperate situations, one is sometimes forced to undertake a hunger strike, of which, generally speaking, there are two types<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup>: political hunger strikes, which have a robust and compelling history in places like India, Cuba, and Northern Ireland; and romantic or interpersonal hunger strikes, on which there is relatively little literature and which are more likely to occur in the context of graduate school or parental correspondence. Typically, a strike is initiated as a method of nonviolent resistance and/or to apply pressure on a perpetrator of injustice. Whatever its specific purpose, a hunger strike must be noticed, perhaps even make a statement, creating a spectacle on which the hunger striker subsists as a normal person would on food. Two examples for the purposes of illustration:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nOctober 10, 2010. Celtic League Secretary Michael Chappell initiates an 11-day hunger strike to protest the British government\u2019s treatment of the territorial integrity of Cornwall. In the end, he claimed to have lost a stone in weight.\r\n<p>\r\nSeptember 5, 2011. I decide to stop speaking, ad infinitum, to a friend on whom I have had a crush for one year to protest his treatment of my easily bruised feelings. Results pending.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, Mr. Chappell\u2013now buckling his belt an impressive eight holes tighter\u2013enjoyed a key advantage that the interpersonal or romantic hunger striker does not: a pervasive media. Not even the news-starved daily press of the most insignificant town would publicize a local resident\u2019s valiant effort to repair a damaged relationship through silence and feigned indifference. Here, I should interject to underscore a critical distinction between interpersonal hunger strikes and \u201cthe silent treatment\u201d or similarly bromidic behaviors. There are no well-defined criteria or aims to regulate the latter, and they inevitably form part of the uninteresting adhocracy which seems to describe much of human interaction. It is one thing to become upset with someone and indulge an impulse to stop speaking to him until one \u201cfeels like it.\u201d A hunger strike is an entirely different matter, as connoisseurs of passive aggressive behaviors will zealously point out. It often follows days of careful reflection, employed as a last resort to correct the egregious and seemingly incorrigible negligence of a wayward friend or romantic interest. The formidability of its terms\u2013deliberate and emotionally demanding\u2013ensures that it is not taken up lightly or spontaneously. If an interpersonal hunger strike is ultimately a campaign to inspire awareness, such awareness is best understood not as a beneficial externality but, rather, as the offender\u2019s resultant acknowledgement of the striker\u2019s worth, signaled by a nontrivial improvement in the former\u2019s basic attentiveness or by other previously uncharacteristic displays of empathy. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/8/bench.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustrations by Tom Tian</i></center></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMost seasoned practitioners acknowledge that hunger strikes in the context of personal relationships\u2013as compared to those undertaken for the sake of a widely-shared cause or ideal\u2013are relatively mild but still unpleasant, entailing a strict regimen of complete social and emotional deprivation and obligating the instigator to abstain from initiating any communication with the offending entity, though it is sometimes permitted to respond to such advances initiated by the other party in a way deemed prudent by the striker. The intrepid pioneers of the interpersonal hunger strike were primarily young children who refused to speak to their parents for up to one hour (maybe several), after which point they usually acquiesced to the offer of some small enticement\u2013a piece of chocolate calculatingly passed across the negotiation table\u2013or, if the stakes were especially high, the threat of indefinite grounding, which universally carried the strike to its endgame. Like middle distance runners in training, many of these children would, as they grew older, heighten their efforts to full attrition warfare, forcing inattentive friends and loved ones to seek redemption by maintaining overwhelmingly superior force of will and strength of conviction\u2013powerful nonverbal tactics which, when employed against a weak character with the proper dose of affectation and self-righteousness, are more than enough to achieve unconditional surrender. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/8/table.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMuch study has been devoted to the biological aspects of hunger\u2013the body\u2019s response after prolonged periods without food, the sorts of physical sensations and medical conditions associated with hunger, and the point at which one reaches the precipice of starvation. Metaphorical hunger proves to be a more elusive phenomenon, and its timeline is far less predictable. Romantic hunger strikers, unable to pinpoint exactly when their diet of the heart will begin to produce gratifying results, must accept a high degree of uncertainty and the likely possibility of a prolonged struggle. These circumstances are especially difficult to weather if one\u2019s academic or professional obligations are not enough to fill the daylight hours and leave the striker in the pit of exhaustion at day\u2019s end. A schedule which permits even a minimal amount of leisure and personal meditation can be damning to someone doing her best to vanquish the temptation to make a forbidden phone call. At the same time, the striker is faced with yet another challenge: to achieve a delicate balance between avoiding the offending party and making an effort to occasionally be in his presence\u2013albeit at a distance\u2013in order to make one\u2019s silence truly felt. Only the most adroit strikers are able to remain sufficiently conspicuous while simultaneously minimizing the risk of actual interaction. Indeed, such perils should be enough to dissuade the faint of heart from ever attempting such an exercise. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/8/scooter.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br>\r\n\r\n<p>\t\r\nThe empirical track record of the romantic hunger strike is dubious, given the unfortunate dearth of carefully collected data. My lack of endurance is regrettable, but I imagine that some people can carry on for days or even weeks. Here, I must highlight a particularly treacherous aspect of the romantic hunger strike: If the individual against whom the strike is initiated is truly as aloof as one would presumably have to be to merit such an action, the strike carries a high risk of going unnoticed. And even novices must realize almost immediately that the criterion of visibility is crucial for the ultimate objective of a romantic hunger strike: to force the person to hunger for the striker as the striker, ever tormented, hungers for him, appealing to his hardened conscience through silent but increasingly evident suffering\u2013suffering for which the wrongdoer should be made, stealthily and indirectly, to feel as guilty as possible. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEnsuring that this last aim is achieved requires a great deal of patience and, above all, a steel resolve to cross the offending party out of one\u2019s life until he repents, verbally or through a change in behavior, for the emotional turmoil he has created through his unequivocal inconsiderateness. It may be a week or more before the striker\u2019s absence is felt and the offender musters the thoughtfulness to make sustained eye contact or send a noncommittal text message. Such is the nature of my current endeavor, a particularly taxing hunger strike that after eight days has produced from its target one very brief multiple-recipient email about the utterly prosaic matter of whether the message\u2019s recipients will be attending a recently-scheduled boat cruise for students in my graduate program (a message to which I will obviously not reply, given my dual hatred of boat cruises and cop-outs). In short, the romantic hunger strike almost always involves a large effort for a small and uncertain prize, though one could argue that it is impossible to put a price on a lean conscience. More often than not, the striker begins to resemble an anteater rooting blindly through a pile of sand\u2013an anteater whose friends would agree would be better off searching elsewhere for sustenance.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/8/bed.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe question is likely to arise, then, of why one would ever initiate a hunger strike in the first place to preserve a relationship that is evidently unhealthy for at least one of its participants. If such questions had easy answers, people like Joni Mitchell and other prominent figures of the \u201clover\u2019s lament\u201d genre would not have profitable careers. Indeed, we owe a great cultural debt to the ambivalence and irrational persistence of the victims of unreciprocated infatuation, who seem to become bitter, prolific authors or singer/songwriters (admittedly of varying quality) at a disproportionate rate. The incredible level of restraint required by hunger strikes undertaken to salvage the most unfulfilling relationships is a large but oddly worthwhile expense incurred in pursuit of romantic solace. After the long silence that comes with being alone in one\u2019s principles, the ultimate reward of a hunger strike will likely depend on the striker\u2019s goals and expectations in the first place\u2013a complete transformation of the offender, a somewhat heightened awareness of the striker\u2019s existence, or merely the satisfaction of having strategically deprived a self-centered individual of attention. My own hunger strikes\u2013of which there have been enough to force me to doubt my social aptitude\u2013have encompassed a sometimes-confusing combination of these objectives, and they are often abandoned after a few days, before I can claim to have shed any emotional weight. The temptation to readopt my habitual congeniality, combined with an utter lack of self-control when it comes to inappropriate crushes, is enough to cut short even my most purifying of fasts.  \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI am convinced, however, that my present hunger strike will mark a decisive turning point in my troubled relationship with its target\u2013a friend and love interest whom I got to know, oddly enough, by offering him a piece of chocolate.  <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src=\"/media/images/8/phone.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name = \"ft1\" href =\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nAs noted in Franz Kafka\u2019s \u201cA Hunger Artist,\u201d hunger strikes for entertainment are no longer viable and therefore do not merit their own category.\r\n</p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nI think a man visited the house when I was seven. He was middle-aged but handsome, carried a guitar case. English was not his mother tongue. My little sister and I led him up the stairs to our apartment. He took his shoes off when he entered, when he saw us take off our shoes. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe continued into the living room. The gentleman sat on a dusty trunk, my sister near him on the couch, and I on the carpet. I crossed my feet beneath me, and locked them in the hollows of my knees.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy sister asked if he had children; her belinted, striped socks kicked at random when she talked. The gentleman told us very frankly that children were too expensive and that he could live how he wanted without them. Above all it was college that was most expensive.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy sister asked if he had a wife. As she asked, she regarded us both, me and the gentlemen, with wide eyes that would have made any glimpse in the direction of her socks extremely obvious. What's strange is that I don't actually remember the <i>gentleman's</i> socks. He said he did not have a wife. Many people he knew did not have wives, he said. One always overestimates how many people have wives and children, he said, because one has married parents. But the inference is fallacious.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI know that he told us a story. I remember the whole story, and on the basis of the story, I know that I must have asked him to show us a trick, but I have no idea why I would have done that. My best guess is that, having heard him called a \u201cperformer,\u201d I assumed he worked at the circus.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cWhen I was a little boy like you I was in a similar situation. A traveling man was visiting the house. We chatted for a while, the traveler, my sister, and I. In hindsight, I think he was probably trying to take a nap, but my sister and I wouldn't leave him alone until he showed us a trick. Here is the trick that the Monsieur showed us.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cThe traveling man opened his guitar case. Inside were thick black snakes. He asked me for a pitcher of water, which he drank, and a sugar cube, and he picked up a snake and let it coil around his wrist. I ran to the cabinet where the sugar was kept, and fetched a cube. The snakes were beginning to squirm, although they remained in the case. The Monsieur raised the snake to his mouth, and showed us the cube of sugar, with his fingers fanned out in a kind of flourish. The snake slowly turned her head as he brought the cube of sugar past her. When he placed it on his tongue the snake followed. The man tilted his head back and the snake slid down. I heard a sound in his throat like laughter.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cHis hand lowered to the guitar case and snakes reached across to it and climbed his arm. He croaked at me for another cube of sugar, and grabbed my wrist. I ran to the kitchen, mostly because I wanted to get away from him. I fetched the sugar anyway, and stood with it, hesitating. He called my name and my sister came after me. She tried to wrest the sugar from my hands\u2026 It spilled all over the floor\u2026 My sister grabbed a bunch in her dress and ran back into the living room.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cWhen we found the man he was covered in blood and the carpet was covered in blood. He was a snake-swallower by trade; ordinarily he would bring them up again alive. But, bickering, we hadn\u2019t brought him the sugar in time. The snakes had become angry, and threatened to attack him. He had been forced to tear them to pieces and really eat them. Now we would have to pay for all the snakes. What\u2019s more, there was a huge mess and we were obviously responsible. And, most of all, our parents would be appalled that we had caused such a horrible thing to a houseguest through our bickering.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHe paused for a long time. \u201cWe were grounded,\u201d he added. Then he leaned back and laughed like a bullfrog.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn his guitar case was a real guitar. He offered to my sister to play and she held the guitar on her lap like a pizza and smacked the strings. The next time my mother wandered through the room I followed her away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSince then, I have researched his story of the snake-swallower, and though it is obviously invented, and certainly a bad joke, some evidence indicates that \u201csnake-swallowers\u201d really did exist; I tracked down a paper by A. Chandrahasan Johnson and Satyabama Johnson in <i>Clinical Radiology</i>, 1969, which describes a snake swallower discovered by two radiologists in Vellore, India. They asked him if he would repeat his act in front of a radioscopic camera, and, injecting the snakes with barium, filmed his stomach and chest. Squiggles of light are swallowed. Their movement downwards is very unnatural-looking, and I had the impression that the film was faked until they landed in his stomach, where they moved gently and gracefully; not at all clustered at the bottom, as I expected, but floating free like trailing ribbons on a maypole. Then he turns and a great fist kicks up out of him; the ribbons fly left, are caught momentarily, and fall. The detail about the pitcher of water is substantiated: the paper states that the man \u201cdrinks copious amounts of water\u201d before his act.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI remember another story from around this time. At first I thought I had read it in <i>Huck Finn,</i> in the chapter about the feuding families, their mansions, and the dead boy. But when I finally reread the book it wasn't there. I'm sure, now, that the gentleman told it. I don't think he told it to me. I imagine him having narrated it to my sister, who sat on his lap, or sprawled elsewhere on the couch. I listened from the doorway. I saw the back of his head, my sister's elbow, the guitar by their feet, and the case open on the carpet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cA wealthy slaveowner, who had been a very fat man, because he seldom left his home, and because he ate constantly, began to starve. He would joke that this was a moral failing of his, and at dinner, if he had guests, he'd make it into a joke, and gulp down a whole rotisserie chicken. Whatever it was, he joked, he'd 'out-eat' it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cHis stomach bulged. It was hard, when you pressed on the side of it, because a tapeworm was living in there.\u201d Here, he pressed my sister\u2019s stomach; she giggled\u2014\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cNo poison would kill it. The slaveowner retched constantly\u2014retching is vomiting when nothing will come out.\u201d My sister's face was blank. He looked at her quizzically, not quite believing in her incomprehension. \u201cIt was decided that the man must fast. But he couldn't keep himself from eating, so he had to be tied down. After three days, a jar of honey was brought to his lips. A white, eyeless head poked out of his teeth. His stomach shrunk, folded, collapsed, as if someone let her knees fall beneath a sheet.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cThe man\u2019s eyes watered. The tapeworm was wide. When its head reached the honey, the doctor grabbed it around the neck and pulled. He pulled ten feet. The man\u2019s face turned grey. The tapeworm had grown too large. The man suffocated.

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nThe prominence of addiction in the societies of classical India is a matter of curiosity to Westerners because we are used to relegating the phenomenon of addiction to the margins and the special cases. To us, it is an inconvenience so remarkable as to be easily avoided. In the literature of ancient Indian civilization at its apex, the vigorous pursuit of pleasure seems to be matched only by the obsessive ethical projects of its elimination. In this article I hope to provide a basis for a future project which will take full account of this richly applicable category. I will proceed chronologically, as the title suggests, from the religious crisis embodied in the Vedas to the competing solutions offered in the Upanishads and the Brahmanas to the attempt to integrate those approaches in the Laws of Manu. At the risk of falling into the common stereotype that everything in India is about religion, I argue here that the development of the idea of addiction (<i>prasanga</i>) is not only rigorously religious in nature at the outset, but is strongly linked to the development of classical Indian religious thought in general.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nCursory interpretations of ancient Indian religion can often give the impression that, until the sudden revolt of asceticism and meditation, the Vedic religious order was steeped in sensuous fecundity, that the sacred wove itself into the texture of the profane, as if gods walked the earth side by side with men. In the compilation of essays entitled <i>The Inner Conflict of Tradition,</i> J.C. Heesterman argues that, on the contrary, meditative brahmanism, rooted in the renunciation of the sensory world, actually has its origins in the earliest known Vedic religion. He proposes that the religion attested in the earliest Vedic texts (probably 1250 BCE) bore marks of an even more ancient, even pre-Vedic custom (perhaps 2000-1500 BCE), in which two hostile priestly parties engaged in violent and destructive battles to \u201cwin\u201d the potlatch-like sacrificial contest and thereby acquire some kind of political or material advantage over one another. Here, the play of sacredness is based on a complementarity between oppositions such as life and death, purity and impurity. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn a sense, this ritual would not have been recognized by its successors as part of a shared tradition. Battle sacrifice did not so much attach itself to the contingencies of the world (pleasure, reproduction, disease, conflict, death), which presumes an interior/exterior opposition, as much as it attempted to enclose those contingencies in its ritual space, represent them symbolically, and thus control their effects. To talk of this institution\u2019s \u201crelation\u201d to sensory functions would be to miss the very immanence of the custom to life itself; the archaeological record even suggests that the loser of the sacrificial contest was beheaded. Thus, the ideas of ritual success and failure were of the most demanding order, and were the organizing principles of this system and its sacredness. And yet there is no consideration of desire as an important <i>human</i> concept in relation to the accomplishment of sacrifical domination (Vedic myth, of course, abounds in stories which reflect on desire [<i>kama,</i> which also means \u201cpleasure\u201d] as an attribute of the gods). Instead, the key notion to keep in mind at this point in our genealogical inquiry is the complementarity of life and death, purity and impurity, success and failure; in any of these binaries, the loss of the negative term would render the system incoherent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBy the time of the composition of the Rig Veda (c. 1250 BCE), a historical moment of religious reform had taken place, during which the agonistic character of the sacrifice is abolished, yielding to a lone ritual observant. The attempted removal of anything considered to be evil, dirty, or violent allows the prescribed order of sacrifice to be invoked, for the first time, not as a venue for competition over the goods of life, but as an immovable, transcendant, and complete code of conduct\u2014in other words, the positing of dharma<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup>. Death, impurity, profanity, failure are relegated outside the program of religious imperatives. In Heesterman\u2019s words: \u201cit is in the consideration of the <i>shrauta</i> ritual that the unresolved dilemma of the dharma\u2019s traditional order stands out most clearly, for the revealed <i>shruti</i> has nothing to say about the world, its concerns and conflicts.\u201d<sup><a name=\"id2\" href=\"#ft2\">2</a></sup> Since <i>shruti</i> texts (including the Vedas themselves) instruct only in the conduct of human life within the sacrificial context<sup><a name=\"id3\" href=\"#ft3\">3</a></sup>, the injunction to conduct oneself in exclusive accordance with the revealed order dramatically limits the scope of the brahmins\u2019 proper engagement with society. After the priestly reformers relegate all traces of death and destruction outside the sacrificial system, they are no longer contained in a tension with life, purity, and sacredness, and so they are dispersed. They become invisible attributes of objects of the mundane world, and the ritualist finds it difficult to distinguish between those objects and the evil residues, expelled from the space of the sacrifice into the world at large, that linger in the field of sense data. This opposition between ritual space and social space gives rise for the first time to the notion of attachment (<i>sanga</i>), though it should be understood specifically as the dependence of a ritual function on an external, secular function. Heesterman mentions a priest\u2019s reliance on his wealthy patron as an example of this type of <i>sanga.</i> \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe brahmin is obliged on the one hand to maintain the ultimate authority of dharma, and on the other hand to come face to face with the religious pollution that has been unleashed onto the sensory world. His ethical world bifurcates into two possible paths. In the ritualist path, he encloses himself in the order of the <i>shrauta</i> ritual, too intimidated by the dangers and conflicts of the ritually unprescribed world. In the renunciant path, he internalizes the ritual itself by drawing analogies between elements of sacrifice and objects of the world. The renunciant has forsaken the action of sacrifice and instead acquires knowledge of sacrifice. He has interrogated the outside world. He has focused his mind on the residues of religious evil and has acquired knowledge of them. Armed with such knowledge, he is capable of maintaining affairs with the world without incurring the consequences of their destructiveness and impurity.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe meditative texts known as the Upanishads are the classical philosophical sources of renunciant brahminism, and the oldest of them (known as <i>mukhya upanishad,</i> probably c. 800-600 BCE) are considered revealed (<i>shruti</i>) according to pious belief. In them, the conflicts within the Vedic tradition are fleshed out, and a more deliberate and conscious response to them is developed. For the purposes of this inquiry, the question arises, what exactly is being renounced? If Heesterman\u2019s view is to be believed, the tensions that produced renunciant brahminism existed prior to the redaction of the early Upanishads and their subsequent widespread veneration and recitation. But it is only by the time of the Upanishads themselves that this renunciation is canonically linked to formal statements of theology. The original renunciatory impulse gives way to a whole new cosmological ideology that supports it and justifies it.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\u201cPrajapati\u2019s offspring were of two kinds: gods and demons. Indeed, the gods were the younger of his offspring, while the demons were the older; and they were competing for these worlds. So the gods said to themselves: \u2018Come, let us overcome the demons during a sacrifice by means of the High Chant.\u2019\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.3.4)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn this passage, the old Vedic gods are fashioned as fixtures of the world. Though they are immortal, and people offer sacrifices to them, they themselves offer sacrifices and chant Vedic verses, as if they are but humans in service to yet higher forms of divinity. Moreover, they are symbolically linked to the needs and conflicts of the exterior world. In contrast to the old Vedic gods, the transcendent underpinning of the dharmic order is reworked as <i>moksha,</i> liberation from the fetters of earthly existence and rooted in knowledge. This liberation from the <i>shrauta</i> ritual order now means that meditation <i>on</i> the sacrifice actually replaces the sacrifice itself, as alluded to above. In fact, a huge proportion of upanishadic text is devoted to drawing analogies between the worldly attributes of the priest and his sensory capacities as a sacrificer: \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\u201cThis is his completeness\u2014his mind is himself; his speech is his wife; his breath is his offspring; his sight is his human wealth, for people find wealth with their sight, while his hearing is his divine wealth, for people hear it with their hearing; and his body is his rites, for one performs rites with one\u2019s body.\u201d (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.17) \r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn one level, this sort of metaphorization of ritual is a survival of that body of concerns that was first prompted by the reform of agonistic sacrifice, the instinct toward ritual enclosure that we saw immediately following that reform, before the bifurcation into ritualism and renunciation. But the metaphorization gives way to a specifically renunciant brahmin imperative to gain knowledge of the \u201chidden connections\u201d<sup><a name=\"id4\" href=\"#ft4\">4</a></sup> between ritual action and earthly realm. From a renunciant perspective, the ritualists, so concerned for the autonomy of their enclosed space from profane reality, are <i>attached to ritual</i> through a desire for heaven, just as foolish people and those who do not know the Vedas are attached to their sensory powers. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt nearly the same time as the composition of the Upanishads, the body of ritualist texts known as the Brahmanas are composed (c. 800 \u2013 600 BCE). The authors and redactors of the Brahmanas are essentially the successors to the tradition of the enclosed sacrifice; they stand opposed to the authors and redactors of the Upanishads. The relation of the Brahmana texts to the nonritual world is to define those aspects which are to be specifically excluded from proper religious conduct, as below:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\u201cBhrigu, the son of Varuna, thought he was better than his father, better than the gods, better than the other Brahmins. Varuna thought, \u2018My son doesn\u2019t know anything. Let\u2019s teach him a lesson.\u2019 He took away his life\u2019s breaths, and Bhrigu fainted and went beyond this world to the world beyond. There he saw a man cut another man to pieces and eat him; and then a man eating another man, who was sreaming; and then a man eating another man, who was soundlessly screaming. He returned from that world and told Varuna what he had seen. Varuna explained that when people who lack true knowledge and offer no oblations cut down trees for firewood, or cook for themselves animals that cry out, or cook for themselves rice and barley, which scream soundlessly, those trees, and animals, and rice and barley take the form of men in the other world and eat those people in return. \u2018How can one avoid that?\u2019 asked Bhrigu. And Varuna replied that you avoid it by putting fuel on the sacred fire and offering oblations.\u201d (Jaiminiya Brahmana, 1.42-44)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAgain, the sacred realm is linked in a series of analogies to the profane realm. Yet clearly the message\u2014perform correct sacrifice, and the rest will take care of itself\u2014is totally divorced from the renunciant message that knowledge of the sacrifice, far better than sacrifice itself, permits the possessor of that knowledge to walk the earth untouched by the invisible debris of cosmic evil. At the same time, the stories embedded in both sets of texts show a loosening from their original polar stances and indeed a degree of mutual influence; the Brahmanas hedge by adding knowledge to correct sacrifice, while Upanishads admit that while knowledge is better than sacrifice, sacrifice is also fine.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Laws of Manu (in Sanskrit, <i>Manusmriti,</i> c. 200 BCE- 200 CE) attempt definitively and comprehensively to mend this breach. The Manu text represents the most influential early codification of religious law into what is recognized as classical Indian religious orthodoxy, or dharma. Although rigidly traditionalistic in its self-representation, the very boldness with which the Manu text puts forth its codification represents a dramatic break in the ritual system. Pre-Vedic battle sacrifice related to the vast contingency of the world by representing it symbolically within itself. The Vedic system of ritualism embodied in the Brahmanas related to the same set of contingencies by prescribing in detail how they are to be detached from the sacrificial order. And the ethic of renunciation embodied in the Upanishads pointed out that the sacrificial order itself is subject to contingencies as long as its realization is confined to the level of action, and therefore attempts to liberate it fully by realizing it instead through the level of knowledge. The Manu text valiantly attempts to integrate all these expectations, and moreover to define a body of codes that are both derived from eternal dharma and universally applicable to man and his complete set of moral concerns. For the first time since the agonistic battle sacrifice, contingency is allowed to assert itself:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\u201cActing out of desire is not approved of, but here on earth there is no such thing as no desire; for even studying the Veda and engaging in the rituals enjoined in the Veda are based on desire. Desire is the very root of the conception of a definite intention, and sacrifices are the result of that intention; all the vows and the duties of restriction are traditionally said to come from the conception of a definite intention. Not a single rite is ever performed here on earth by a man without desire; for each and every thing that he does is motivated by the desire for precisely that thing. The man who is properly occupied in desires goes to the world of the immortals, and here on earth, he achieves all the desires for which he has conceived an intention.\u201d (Manu 2.2-5)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHere for the first time we are given an explicit theory of desire in relation to a moral code. Both the ethic of renunciation in the Upanishads and the insular ritualism of the Brahmanas sought to eliminate any notion of human contingency as an attribute of their codes. Only by directly undermining that project, and embracing a notion of attachedness as something that frames man\u2019s relation to his own affairs, can the Manu text undertake its own project, to put forth a practical and complete set of instructions for correct conduct. And yet, the evils of desire and the virtues of successful resistance against addiction underpin nearly every rule that the Manu text promulgates!\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe most famous expression of the idea of addiction is the analogy of the human sensory powers to a group of horses: \u201cA learned man should keep trying hard to restrain his sensory powers as they run amok among alluring sensory objects, like a charioteer restraining his race-horses.\u201d  (Manu 2.88) From the perspective of the earlier ritual attitudes toward the sensory world, to put forth this metaphor is a clear encroachment on religious space. Imagine a life lived each moment as the charioteer! The Manu text effectively foments crisis by locating the threat of addiction at every turn, and by then warning against it in the strongest terms. \u201cDesire is never extinguished by the enjoyment of what is desired, it just grows stronger, like a fire that flares up with the oblation, and burns a dark path.\u201d (2.94)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs alluded to above, addiction underpins nearly all instruction; where previously all one had to do to affirm the absolute autonomy of dharma was to ensure a reasonable spatial and symbolic interval between religious and secular space, in Manu, desire is immanent in all of man\u2019s affairs. The text explains that the \u201cconfused classes\u201d (10.25), people whose parents belonged to different social classes, are the result of sexual addictions. The simple notion of prohibition is insufficient to the task of this text, whose project is to uphold prohibitions insofar as they both lead a person to failure and rob him of his autonomy.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Manu text, then, is faced with the idea that all desire is attachment (Upanishads), and that all attachment leads to ruin (Brahmanas). Yet is also faced with the idea that desire underpins all human activity, good and bad. (The latter idea was rooted in the agonistic sacrifice that aspired to material goods or political control, and there is no doubt that beneficial sacrifice survived as a brahmin institution throughout the period of pre-Manu Vedic meditative development). In order to navigate this tricky and contradictory system of imperatives, the text devises strategies to apprehend one\u2019s own attachments: \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\u201cSomeone may attain all of these desires and someone may reject them all, but the rejection of all desires is better than the attainment. Those sensory powers that take voluptuous pleasure in the sensory objects cannot be restrained by non-indulgence as well as by constant understanding. The Vedas, rejection of desires, sacrifices, restraints, the generation of inner heat\u2014they never bring perfect success to a man whose nature has been corrupted. A man who neither thrills nor recoils when he hears, touches, sees, tastes, or smells anything\u2014he should be known as a man who has conquered his sensory powers.\u201d (2.95-98)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe Manu text commends desire as the root of correct sacrifice (above), and certainly commends sacrifice as a dharmic imperative that leads to the fulfillment of worldly goals. Yet it also commends knowledge as a superior replacement to correct action. These movements within the text are almost frantic, but their purpose is clearly to put a spotlight on addiction and to hold it out as the anti-ideal. It allows the Manu text to mend the breach between ritualism and renunciation, to stipulate the existence of constructive versus destructive desires. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe idea of addiction is in opposition to the idea of autonomy, and thus contingency, that which allows bare facts to arrive on the scene and exercise dominance over it, is at the root of addiction. From the beginning, what is warned against is an imagined spatial relationship with some contingency\u2014the unritual exterior, action as incommensurate with knowledge, attachment to pleasure, attachment to success, and finally, addiction, the near-unseverable attachment. At each stage of the development of the idea of addiction, the play of contingency has determined not only a couple of key terms in each respective discourse, but the whole code, the whole manner in which dharma is approached. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\">\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nDharma (n): law, right, order, society, custom, duty, propriety, religion; literally, that which upholds or supports; cognate with Latin <i>firmus,</i> \u201cstable,\u201d and Greek <i>thronos,</i> \u201cthrone.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft2\" href=\"#id2\">2</a></sup>\r\n<i>Shruti</i> refers to a relatively small body of old texts that are thought to be divinely given, as opposed to those designated <i>smriti,</i> passed on as a matter of tradition. <i>Shrauta</i> is a derivation of <i>shruti,</i> and refers to practices that are ideologically or programmatically aligned with the privilege enjoyed by <i>shruti</i> texts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft3\" href=\"#id3\">3</a></sup>\r\nRemember, in the system of agonistic battle sacrifice, the inherent oppositions of productive life are contained within the ritual.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name =\"ft4\" href =\"#id4\">4</a></sup>\r\nA traditional gloss on the name <i>upanishad</i> itself.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

The Hypothesis. </h3>\r\n<p>\u201cSnacking\u201d is the artist\u2019s constant and fluid documentation of small and inspirational encounters with nouns: People, places, objects, and words. The motivation behind snacking is the eventual saturation and subsequent output of art influenced by these encounters. Documentation occurs most often by way of notation, although picture and video are also quite acceptable. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cSnackology\u201d is the study of the artist\u2019s Snacking patterns, both to further engage in the exploration of individual aesthetic as well as to further awareness of Snacking as a collective form. The element of sharing found Snacks is introduced here, and the relationship between Snacker, Snack, and wider audience is beneficial (if not imperative) to the furthering of the Snack\u2019s presence in the artistic process.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. The History</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Harriet the Spy.</i> The love for a belt of tools, a seeming grab-bag of trinkets looped in loops and slung on waists. And, of course, the journal. I could live without the tomato sandwiches and the egg creams. But, oh, I say, the journal. Composition Book complete with Rorschach blot cover, pages rife with wide-ruled freshness. Harriet is to be emulated; it was she who set the stage for the Snackery and Scribery. The method to the madness had yet to be seen.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt may all have started back when I used to sleep with all of the stuffed animals on the bed with me for fear of furry hurt feelings. Or when I would save the wrappers of a year\u2019s worth of Trick-or-Treat candy to preserve the memory of each gloomy house, each doorbell rung, each spooky motion-activated woo-ing ghost and/or dancing spider. My habits for sentimentalizing and humanizing objects, places, turns of phrase, odd findings, chance, coincidence, strange road signs, breakfast foods, keys, grandma\u2019s jewelry box, door handles, and curtains seemed innocent and weird. Spoons were Cinderella, napkins fashioned the ball gown, and Forks played Prince Charming. They would dance across tabletops until dinner was served.  And I was safe in my habits before I knew what they were.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Snacking movement begins and ends with wonder, with questions, with a curious eye. It\u2019s the middle parts, the linking bones, the tiny puzzle pieces brought together in curvature to create the journey of the Snacker\u2019s process. A wandering eye may peep-Thom at the Snacker-in-action and label it strange. And what isn\u2019t strange about the glints and glimmers of ourselves we find in objects? And what isn\u2019t strange about our constant, cyclical need for reassurance, for satisfaction? Strange we may be, we snackers/artists/humans, but our strangeness we embrace.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. What are Snacks?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nSnacks can be defined as non-meals. The small foods we ingest to curb tiny bouts of hunger. Betwixt the nutritionally sanctioned three meals a day, our tummies grumble and we reach for a small cluster of what-have-yous. The morsels we pop, chew, and swallow are often forgotten on their way past the gums. Just a simple lift, a nutritional boost. Just \u201ca little something to hold me over.\u201d But a true Snacker is someone who holds dear each M&M, who licks the thumb and index finger after each deft pluck of a Cheeto. Someone who sees the beauty in the little things, who acknowledges the imperative role specificity plays in cultivating the richness of the everyday. Snack, in our context, passes beyond the realm of the edible; we\u2019re talking not about the morsels of mouth, but the morsels of mind. They are the bits that trick us into entering into a dialogue with them, just as them tater chips trick us into munching on a handful. Of course, we don\u2019t usually tell our friends how awesome them tater chips is, but that\u2019s half the fun of Snackin\u2019.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so I say! Snacking = a form of miniature satiation and inspiration, and this form can be applied to several different contexts. Well, I have only applied it to the creation and the enriching of Art, but I imagine that other contexts could benefit from it. I imagine that day-trading is a form of snacking. Amateur bird-watching. Sporting events aired on smaller-grade ESPNS, like Strong-Man Competitions and Tournament Bowling.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nMy penchant for classic emotional hoardism displaced itself into my note-taking, my quote-taking somewhere between my first viewing of <i>Titanic</i> and senior year of college. I felt the need to corroborate my findings and distribute them, in an attempt to inspire others to do the same. And so, my snacking became public with the vast and winding channels of Dickens, through a quote from <i>Bleak House</i> emailed to friends and teachers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\"Mr. Skimpole, having 'nothing to live upon but love, fell in love, and married, and surrounded himself with rosy cheeks.' His good friend Jarndyce and some other of his good friends then helped him, in quicker or slower succession, to several openings in life; but to no purpose, for he must confess to two of the oldest infirmities in the world: one was, that he had no idea of time; the other, that he had no idea of money. In consequence of which he never kept an appointment, never could transact any business, and never knew the value of anything! Well! So he had got on in life, and here he was! He was very fond of reading the papers, very fond of making fancy sketches with a pencil, very fond of nature, very fond of art. All he asked of society was to let him live. That wasn't much. His wants were few. Give him the papers, conversation, music, mutton, coffee, landscape, fruit in the season, a few sheets of Bristol-board, and a little claret, and he asked no more. He was a mere child in the world, but he didn't cry for the moon. He said to the world, 'Go your several ways in peace! Wear red coats, blue coats, lawn sleeves, put pens behind\r\nyour ears, wear aprons, go after glory, holiness, commerce, trade, and object you prefer; only--let Harold Skimpole live!\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn response, I received quotes from Rilke (\u201cWomen, in whom life lingers and dwells more immediately, more fruitfully and more confidently, must surely have become fundamentally riper people\u2026\u201d), Voltaire (\u201cWe must cultivate our own garden.\u201d), and a YouTube clip from <i>Family Guy</i> (\u201cOh ma Gawd, you\u2019re a horse?\u201d). One response, from a dear friend named Elinor, included this:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t\u201cPS. I dig the subject line of this your email... better tasting snacks than the Tostitos and Con Queso dip I'm eating.\u201d\r\n</blockquote>\t\r\n<h3>4. The Elements</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nI. OBJECT. A ten-cent photo from a street vendor. A pair of dice from an antique shop. A broke-down \u201957 Chevy pickup on I-17. The phrase \u201chuman beans.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nII. PRESERVATION OF ARTIST\u2019S RELATIONSHIP TO OBJECT. The buying of the photo. The rolling of the dice. The picture of the Chevy. The Tweeting of \u201chuman beans.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIII. SHARING OF PRESERVATION. Via oral recounting, blog, email chain. A public display of affection to the moment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIV. THIRD PARTY RESPONSE. The email reply, the Facebook \u201clike,\u201d the conversation, the giggling spawned over \u201chuman beans.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nV. IMPLEMENTING PRESERVATION IN WORK OF ART BASED ON ARTICLES I-IV. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. An Example</h3>\r\n<p>In the bracing and bunkering and hunkering down for Hurricane Irene, my roommates and I were listening to NPR and prepping a hefty game of RISK. One of the interviews centered around Cheryl, a Coney Island resident who did not evacuate the area, but instead stayed behind and spent the night at her local evacuation center; in this instance, it happened to be the Coney Island Museum. Spending the night at a Carnival show, with tin toys, ventriloquist dummies, penny farthings and photographs of famous elephants. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLater that night, I was cleaning out my paper bin (or bins. One who Snacks is bound to several crates of tiny notes and tchotchkes). I found a stack of calling lists, registration forms, and informational brochures from a Speeddating service I once had the misfortune of working for. Immediately, parallels between the Coney Island evacuation museum and the inherent truths of Speeddating made themselves known: Insecure and worried people in a tiny space for an established amount of time. Strangers forced to know each other. People prone to sweating, prone to shouting, people unhappy in their circumstance, people trapped in their fever dreams, people with bursting synapses, people foaming at the mouth. People with everything at stake: house and home, family, future. It all hangs in the balance and the scales may tip in the next moment. The ring of the bell, the sounding of the alarm. A storm brewing in the distance, a heart beating. The need for eye contact, for human contact, for the calling of and/or seeking of loved ones. A vacuum of space and time, a room full of silence and small talk, the yearn for connection, the yearn for the outside world.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don\u2019t know. It would make a good play. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"> </p>\r\n",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nPeter Greenaway has always been a prodigal son of the film world. His films, stunning works of art that rely heavily on sensory and intellectual overload, are born out of a deep hate for Hollywood stagnancy, which Greenaway plainly admits to: \u201cScorsese has made no progress from D.W. Griffith.\u201d They do not occupy subject matter so much as enact treatises and homage. Thus, while his subjects and motifs change from film to film (love and sex, death and decay, symmetry and asymmetry, etc.), the Greenaway style of literary and phantasmagoric, slow and excessive, proud and portentous, manages to retain itself. If you have not seen his films, imagine <i>Prospero\u2019s Books,</i> which has nearly a hundred nude actors, some perpetually urinating, in a multimedia adaptation of <i>The Tempest;</i> or <i>A Zed and Two Noughts,</i> which, in theorizing taxonomy, features scenes lit by 26 different sources of light. At times it feels as if the screen will burst, whether from the dense and stunning imagery or the pretension. And eventually it did, in a way: Greenaway stopped making narrative films in 1999, and has moved on to performance video and installations. \u201cThe cinema is dead, long live the cinema.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI have always been intrigued by Greenaway\u2019s 1989 film, <i>The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover.</i> It is his most popular and most memorable movie, in part for its prominent display of a gartered and naked Helen Mirren, and its unsettling finale which involves a cooked penis (remember, this was years before \"I Survived <i>Antichrist</i>\" shirts went on sale). I like it because it contains one of the most cinematographically innovative sets ever made, three enormous rooms set side by side, each with their own decor and color scheme, which the camera tracks between seamlessly as the narrative arc builds and builds. It allows for a sort of psychosomatic mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, which is not so common in other Greenaway films because of the distance they keep from their subjects.  Regardless, the film indulges on formalist pretensions: elaborate costumes, artificial lighting, Dutch paintings, French food, and no doubt many other high art and society references which my modest New World upbringing has spared me from.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAll these engorging elements fit nicely with the film's theme: food and sex. (To be technical about it, overconsumption and sexual repression.) Even the aspect ratio is far beyond the standard 16:9. Content and form merge. This theme of overeating is given human form as Albert Spica, the Thief, played by Michael Gambon, who most of us know as the latter Dumbledore. The Thief is a sociopathic mob boss who spends most of his time at his own upscale French restaurant, surrounded by his miserable wife (Mirren) and dimwit toadies. From out of the Thief's mouth spews a river of vituperative gristle, both verbal and physical. The film is basically a series of satanic Last Suppers, from which the Wife eventually relieves herself through an in-restaurant affair with a more humble patron. Her Lover's brown corduroy jacket and modest entrees are a lifesaver in the dining room's lake of fire red. They first meet in the bathroom (the final resting place of food), and later consummate their rebellious affection in the kitchen's meat locker, where cold flesh meets desperate warmth. As I mentioned above, the film heads in some wild directions from there.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI figured that the film's generous portions of sex, violence, vomiting, elimination, food prep, etc., all pointed towards some underlying and grandiose statement on hunger and human desire, probably Freud-inspired, locked away under the mire of symbolism. Rather than fight fire with fire and take the Western academic approach to the film, I decided to ask my acupuncturist how Traditional Chinese Medicine approaches hunger and eating disorders. She told me that eating disorders stem from an imbalance in the stomach's earth energy. This is \u201cearth\u201d energy in the Mother Earth sense, the dual nutrition/nurturing that occurs in the first moments of breast-feeding. Even in the Kundalini tradition, the stomach is the site of nurturing and sensual behavior. This makes sense: the Wife, plagued by an abusive binge-eater, attacked by an eating disorder, ultimately resorts to love, and a lover who loves books. I can\u2019t help but point out that her lover and his home are adorned in the earthy tone of old books. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe acupuncturist clarifies something, that TCM is not just clinically different than Western Medicine, but philosophically also. It is a question of how to treat a disorder. Indeed, the biggest problem of psychoanalysis (which very much informs this film) is that patients can never talk or read their way out of their problems. Which is why, for the Wife, resorting to books eventually fails. The Wife dreams of staying in her Lover\u2019s palace of books, hidden away from the pain and disorder of the world. But, crucially, this 'art and intellect will save us' credo slipped into the beginning of the film's sixth act (of seven) turns out to be false. To think is not enough. This film, which is constantly at risk of being self-consumed, over-excessive, ouroboric, stuffy, navel-gazing, engorged, bloated, full of itself, full of shit, in the end redeems itself, is holistic. It says thought will kill us if we do not eventually act, the exact reason why Greenaway left the cinematheque in the first place, because \u201cwe can no longer sit in a dark room staring at a wall, we must move.\u201d It seems that this was Greenaway\u2019s solution to his eating problem. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>",

            "rendered_content": "<blockquote>\r\n\u201cWe had learned from hard experience that morphing can be extremely disturbing. Jake had morphed into a lizard and been almost overpowered by the animal's fearful brain. The same had happened to Rachel when she'd morphed a shrew. She still had nightmares about the shrew experience\u2013its fear and, worse, its hunger for bugs and rotting flesh.\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cOn the other hand, Jake had morphed into a flea, and according to him it was kind of a big nothing. Like being trapped inside a very old, very bad video game where you could barely see anything. The flea brain had been too simple to make trouble.\u201d\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe <a href = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animorphs><i>Animorphs</i></a> series is consumer-friendly; no matter which book you start with, you get all the important background information. So the morphing process gets described over and over again.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFirst there's the utter strangeness of feeling your body parts shrink and grow and move around, feeling your ears slide to the top of your head; not painful exactly, more like (we learn every time) a novocaine experience at the dentist. There's also the strangeness of how your morphing friends look in the meantime; you may see familiar eyes behind a two-foot-long floppy gray nose\u2013a horrifying freak show, but thankfully a brief one.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThen, once you're in morph, there's the strangeness of the animal you've become: you have cool powers, but you have new instincts too. You risk succumbing to those instincts. Sometimes you risk eating your friends. Luckily, after a few minutes, and less than that with practice, you remember yourself and gain control. I am Catherine, <i>Catherine</i>, you think. You remember your name and everything that comes with it. This keeps you tame.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, there's the usual mention of the two-hour time limit. You must morph back to your human form within two hours\u2013otherwise you'll be stuck in that morph forever. So the mission will have to be quick. Whenever someone points this out in thought-speak, the others all glance at Tobias to remind themselves. Tobias got stuck in morph. Now he is a hawk, forever. But usually he still remembers himself\u2013remembers his old life, remembers who he is and what he stands for. Usually.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n<p>\r\nMetaphysically speaking, this bothered me a little bit. Middle school me, I mean. After the Animorphs morph, they're <i>animals</i>. Right? Tobias is a <i>hawk</i> now. So that means he has a <i>hawk brain</i>. So where does his old self come in? Even supposing you somehow carry your memories with you into morph. Via magical Andalite technology. Why should you care that once, long ago, you wanted to stay human?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI imagined a tiger mind engrossed in tiger thoughts. It calculates how delicious this squirming human prey will be versus how dangerous. When Jake is in tiger morph, could his old name worm its way into that mental context? What could a name say about deliciousness OR dangerousness?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was a question of how your past self could influence your future self, and why your future self should let it. But there had to be some way in. Maybe animal psychology would uncover a loophole, I thought.\u00a0I imagined rewriting the passages where characters morph to make them more plausible.\u00a0Maybe tigers have strong kinship bonds, and maybe certain memories would bring a tiger to recognize the other Animorphs as kin. The tiger would then wonder what it takes to protect such a weird family. A family that was trying to save the world from an alien invasion! This would obviously blow the tiger's mind so hard that it would falter and succumb.\r\n</p>\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n<p>\r\nOn December 31, 1998, I made a New Year's resolution not to fall out of love with the Animorphs series.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI was starting to slip away.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI still dreamt about the Animorphs some nights. I still tried to send thoughts to any red-tailed hawk I saw, hoping it was Tobias (this was futile, though, as humans in human form cannot thought-speak). I still reassured myself every time I had to do homework or clean my room or deal with any other seventh-grade hardship that at least I didn't have to save the world from an alien race of parasitic brain slugs. (\"Self-pity is a pointless emotion,\" Tobias says somewhere; I drew upon this for strength.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut I was straining. Maybe I was a new person now. Or maybe I had just read too many of the books and gotten bored with the repetitions. The novocaine mention, but also fight scenes that happened the same way every time, characters that remained suited to the same one-line descriptions... I tried to block my irritation. <<i>No. NO. I am obsessed with the Animorphs,</i>> I would insist.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI closed my eyes and made myself remember. Here there will be spoilers. I remembered the moment when Marco discovers that his drowned mother is really still alive (\"My mom. Visser One.\"); I remembered when Jake's enslaved brother Tom, trying to lure him into the aliens' trap, actually flinches (\"Tom\u2013the real Tom, not the Yeerk slug in his head\u2013had tried to warn me.\"); I remembered when Tobias flies up toward the skylight at full speed, the hawk in him wanting the sky, the human in him wanting to die. It was easy for everyone to dismiss the Animorphs, too easy. They even made a stupid TV show out of it. But there were some very real things in these books, I thought, human things.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI signed up for a special thing on the Animorphs official website that was supposed to make me an elite fan. I think it cost money. They mailed me some things, I don't know what, except there was a necklace, a little piece of metal on a string. It had an engraved letter \"A\". Clearly unworthy of the Animorphs. I should have thrown it away immediately. It is probably indicative of the strain I was going through that I did not. Instead I wore it around my neck, under my clothes. I tried to tell myself it was some kind of good luck charm. I chained myself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut the truth was that I wanted something more. I wanted to see something less shiny and repetitive and consumer-packaged, maybe something danker, something more like rotting flesh. I wanted the Animorphs to feel so out of touch with their own species, the species they were secretly saving, that they just couldn't show up for gymnastics class anymore. I wanted them to morph the opposite sex and touch themselves in the bathroom. I wanted them to develop obsessions that they had to keep secret from each other. I wanted them to learn lasting things from the minds of the animals they morphed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI tried. I really did. But my resolution didn't last the year.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n<p>\r\nI don't think it's possible to just not commit to some form of continuity. It's not like you can smoothly become what you newly are at every moment, and anyway, if you did you'd be inhuman. It's human to be subjected to your past. But the past is a big and diverse place, and I'm not sure how to tell what to bring forth into the future. Or what it's even possible to bring forth.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt's weird: when you morph, your clothes morph with you, but your shoes stay behind. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>",

I was running, and in the long afternoon my shadow looked really <i>good.</i> My upper arms looked wrung out and my shoulders were hunched in that skinny way. I was in jogging stance, my forearms raised and fists balled up, and the position of everything and of the sun made my shadow reveal that she had only two half-arms. And when I caught myself, I was playing with that form--shifting my body to perfect the amputations, pausing mid-stride to cut off a leg\u2014and I was laughing and full with triumph. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>What was I doing.</i> I should have been thinking, or at least studying the sky. So I looked at the sky. Still big. Hedges. McMansions. <i>Thump thumpthump:</i> sneakers smack against the concrete. The harder the thump the more calories burned per thump.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI placed myself in isolation this summer in my parents' empty house on the South Fork of Long Island in order to get serious. I was also working full-time at a clothing boutique, the kind where it is just me in a room full of mirrors and occasionally a super-anorexic 55-year-old would walk in and sneer if I deigned to ask whether she\u2019d like to <i>try it on.</i> (Apparently, when she holds it out like that, one is simply supposed to go fetch and ring it up\u2014why bother trying on five hundred dollars worth of cotton?) Anyhow. When I was not fetching, I was placed in front of my laptop, getting serious.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Thump thumpthump.</i> Give in: walk down the hall, up the stairs, down the hall, and right up to the full-length mirror. Bend over. Slip my hands from behind my thighs and pull the meat back. Grab hold of the muffin top and yank it out of sight. Peel away the teacher\u2019s flab. The habit becomes disgustingly obsessive\u2014I begin to do it what, I don\u2019t know, this is awful to admit, every fifteen minutes? Ten?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat did he once tell me?\r\n</p>\r\n<p><i>If a woman spent half the time in front of the mirror, she could become fluent in Latin, and French, or something. Virginia Woolf?</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>***</h3>\r\n<p>This is <i>not</i> going to become an article on that-kind-of-hunger.</p>\r\n<p>I am not even hungry. I\u2019ll never be ballsy enough for anorexia; I eat; I eat just like a regular person; in fact, aside from the briefest of adolescent flings with bulimia, I probably ate far more than the average female because I was so hung up on not becoming one of those stupid anorexic types; I got off on proving my difference via stuffing my face in front of lovers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI am not even hungry; I am not a stupid girl. I know what stupid girls look like. I had a loudly anorexic roommate in boarding school who drooled over her homepage, the Coldstone Creamery website. (Kate Moss was her desktop.) She and her anorexic posse would parade around campus trading starvation tips and gnawing dried seaweed: <i>she</i> was a stupid girl. <i>We</i> would laugh at her. I would laugh, before excusing myself to go shimmy my fingers down to heave up Diet Peach Snapple Iced Tea. Whatever. I went to college. I discovered Philosophy. <i>Well...</i> I met truly intelligent girls who were super into higher, intelligent things; they were beautiful, and thin, but their bodies seemed the design of the luck of the draw.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I ate, and read the assigned portions of Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s <i>The Second Sex</i> from a used copy I got from a friend-of-a-friend, a well-known misogynist. I remembered his comments more than I remembered the text: he wrote <i>ugh, ugh, hahaha ha ha ha, wtf,</i> et cetera, in the margins. I ate, and refused to exercise because only weak girls who thought about their bodies instead of higher things did <i>that;</i> I continued to think about my body. I would sneak peeks of her; I would hate her; I would focus in on a single feature and feel alright\u2014but this is precisely what the duped woman does: look in the mirror and believe she has discovered herself; even the women who believe themselves to be ugly do <i>that.</i> Simone Weil might have said that \u201ca beautiful woman looking at her image in the mirror may very well believe the image is herself. An ugly woman knows better.\u201d But how can we trust Weil on the matter? Anorexia killed the mystic!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe other Simone knows better. In her section on \u201cThe Narcissist\u201d she writes that even the \u201cless advantaged\u201d experience the \u201cecstasy of the mirror\u201d; \u201cmoved by the mere fact of being a thing of flesh, which is there\u2026 with a little bad faith they will also endow their generic qualities with an individual charm.\u201d Why the bad faith? De Beauvoir explains the magic of the mirror:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nIt is above all in woman that the reflection allows itself to be assimilated to the self. Male beauty is a sign of transcendence, that of woman has the passivity of immanence: the latter alone is made to arrest man\u2019s gaze and can thus be caught in the immobile trap of the mirror\u2019s silvering; man who feels and wants himself to be activity and subjectivity does not recognize himself in his immobile image...while the woman, knowing she is and making herself object, really believes she is seeing <i>herself</i> in the mirror: passive and given, the reflection is a thing like herself\u2026\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThe mirror\u2019s draw moves beyond satiating mere superficiality: gazing into the mirror is gazing into one\u2019s image to puzzle out who one <i>is;</i> it is\u2014despite knowing better\u2014being affected by the swarmy men who whisper as you scurry down the street that you have beautiful windows-to-the-soul; you go home to peer into glass and block out the bad flesh to locate that soul. De Beauvoir elucidated <i>that</i> sixty-odd years ago so bright, educated women like me would not fall into this <i>full-human-being-which-means-nonstop-transcendence-and-constant-becoming</i>-sucking trap that countless women fall into of staring at their reflections to find oneself in all their glorious immanence. And yet there I was, locking myself into the handicapped stall with the bigger mirror to study my appearance when I should have been reading <i>The Second Sex,</i> just to make sure that I was still there, and hating myself for it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd here I still am. The shame of my compulsion to look into mirrors has grown over years but the shame is not enough to break the habit. Hatred feeds hatred. \u201cHating my body\u201d barely kisses the surface (I can block out the thighs, the arms, the fat that suffocates the cheekbones; besides, it is difficult for me to imagine sincerely hating flesh): it is hating myself for being such a <i>female,</i> such a <i>bad woman,</i> compulsively drawn to the mirror even though I knew better. And then\u2014burying deeper still\u2014hating myself for hating myself during these moments of entrapment. For I <i>know</i> that this hatred plays the same tricks\u2014is as intoxicating, and provides the same false and <i>human-being-becoming</i>-destroying sense of fullness\u2014as the pure enthrallment of the mirror herself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And yet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is no hunger, simply thoughts about hunger that gnaw away at the place where the mind should be: first, the desire to be hungry so I can look better; then, the desire to be full as punishment for being so stupid as to waste my life thinking about how I look; if I am full enough then perhaps the taste can block out these wasteful thoughts. Next, hating feeling full because now I will get fat and moreover I will be stuffed with silly thoughts like that I\u2019m going to get fat; there is the guilt of feeling full because I was still duped into bad eating habits, which means weak womanhood, because I put the food to my mouth not out of hunger but because of some idea circling around what it means for me to be a woman; the hatred of feeling full because feeling full is like feeling plenitude, immanence, weighed down to the ground and unable to transcend. The desire to be light enough to transcend: the desire for hunger.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Itchy. It feels itchy, like there are ants making an anthill out of the inside of my skull, their infinite tiny pricklish little legs tickling the tender bits of my mind. I see insects where there are none: jumping back at a nonexistent speck on the floor; nightmares of roaches tumbling onto my naked self when I turn on the shower faucet; close my eyes and there is a giant bedbug like a crest stuck on the wall in front of me. I feel like a hysterical woman; I feel like I cannot go on: voices and voices and voices breaking apart and doubling back and shouting and whimpering and apologizing and for every voice there is a new one yanking the other back from behind. They are digging a grave: scratching into the place where the mind should be a giant... deep... hole...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Hole? Like how a woman is a hole? Maybe I am just thinking like a real woman! Why are narratives so linear like a cock anyhow? I will write about it. If I cannot escape this hole then at least I can spit it out of my body by turning it into art! But wait. Aren\u2019t I not supposed to take symbols seriously? And who am I to suppose that other women have this paralyzing, spiraling anxiety? Bad me!</i> A woman is a person who defines herself as such\u2014<i>a woman is not a person desperately trying not to fall into their hole! But what about Grandma? And Grandma? And Grandma? No! You are a bad feminist for your thoughts: women are totally fine! Do</i> not <i>write it. Why put another weak woman out there in the world: you need to create strong women, role models to help out fools like yourself. Feminist art killed itself anyhow. That\u2019s because women are fine. If you are not fine, do not write. What are you doing? Not writing? You are acting just like a woman: unable to finish anything that you start! Awwwww. Pity pitiless me, destined to be a weak woman just like all your forefathers and weaker still for believing such trash. Destined to be a weak woman and a bad feminist in a\u2014what is it called\u2014post-feminist world!</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>***</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nDestiny has always been an extraordinarily seductive mindfuck. To believe that all one\u2019s schizoid thoughts and ugly feelings weave together into some sense-making noose; that one\u2019s minute, life-altering regrets are drowned beneath the boom of <i>it must be;</i> to believe that there is a guardian so that one\u2019s excruciating anxiety is not useless suffering but is special, and makes one that special, precious little individual that one is\u2014how divine! Destiny is immanence with reason. One need not practice active engagement with the outside world in order to become the person she wants to be because, if one believes in destiny\u2014that is to say, if one is destined\u2014then one already is the person one must become. Stew in your immanence! Dodge the abyss! No wonder my favorite extracurricular of early collegehood was spreading out on the chaise lounge so this boy could practice psychoanalysis. The Sisters Moirae and their spinning machine might have disappeared long ago but we always keep around some office for Destiny. Like God, Destiny is low maintenance: we can forget her when we are feeling good enough to act free but when the schizophrenia hits she is back, the explanation for why we have just spent the last eight hours inert with hysteria, door locked and shades drawn.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo Destiny has always been a good fuck, particularly for women. In de Beauvoir\u2019s dissection of the Narcissist, the Mystic, and the Woman in Love, what ropes the three female \u201cjustifications\u201d together is that they are all sown from the same seed: the desire that grows to belief that she is destined, which allows the woman to steep in her immanence. The Narcissist, once a child pampered with attention, realizes one day that she is just a number in an infinite line of faceless women. She falls in love with herself. Nestled in the conviction that she cannot step out of this row, she tries to become an individual nonetheless by making a character out of herself with the material at hand. \u201cShe chooses a color. \u2018Green is really my color\u2019; she has a favorite flower, perfume, musician, superstitions and fetishes that she treats with respect\u2026 Around this heroine, life goes on like a sad or marvelous novel, always somewhat strange.\u201d The Narcissist believes ferociously in her inner life: rather than activities, she has secrets to explain who she is. The girl is a bore to be around: because she must constantly play the character that is already her in order to maintain a sense of self, \u201cshe no longer listens, she talks, and when she talks, she recites her lines.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Woman in Love is the most obvious example of the female who builds a nest in her immanence, putting aside the activities that once brought her pride and excitement because attaching herself to her lover is enough; what personality she once had falls away. De Beauvoir elucidates the peculiar fervor that brands womanly love:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nIt is the difference in their situations that is reflected in the conceptions man and woman have of love. The individual who is a subject, who is himself, endeavors to extend his grasp on the world if he has the generous inclination for transcendence: he is ambitious, he acts. But an inessential being cannot discover the absolute in the heart of his subjectivity; a being doomed to immanence could not realize himself in his acts. Closed off in the sphere of the relative, destined for the male from her earliest childhood, used to seeing him as a sovereign, with whom equality is not permitted, the woman who has not suppressed her claim to be human will dream of surpassing her being toward one of those superior beings, of becoming one, of fusing with the sovereign subject; there is no other way out for her than losing her body and soul in the one designated to her as the absolute, as the essential.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nTricking herself into playing the Woman in Love allows the girl to dodge that horrific moment of confronting one\u2019s endless freedom; the role of the Woman in Love allows her to feel full, satiated, purposeful. Even as she immolates herself in order to become one with her lover, she can still maintain the belief that wallowing in her immanence is all that is required to make her life her <i>own,</i> so long as the boy-idol keeps up the lie that he still loves her for who she <i>is,</i> and does not tell her that she has fallen into some badly drawn shadow of his and noon is rapidly approaching:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nLove is the revealer that shows up in positive and clear traits the dull negative image as empty as a blank print; the woman\u2019s face, the curves of her body, her childhood memories, her dried tears, her dresses, her habits, her universe, everything she is, everything that belongs to her, escapes contingence and becomes necessary: she is a marvelous gift at the foot of her god\u2019s altar.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Mystic\u2019s decision to lose herself to God rather than a man-boy is a wise one. God is absent; man is present. If the woman cannot maintain the lie that her man is her god\u2014or if he is good enough to call her out on the fact that she is no longer the person he fell in love with; that it would be difficult, in fact, to even call her a person\u2014then the woman becomes a masochist. Masochism occurs when \u201cthe consciousness of the subject turns to the ego to grasp its humiliated situation.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>Hit me. Tie me up,</i> I cried. He split.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>***</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nOr the woman will get so crippled by the fear that she is on the verge of becoming the Woman in Love that she will flood with anxiety, thus causing her to cling to her bloated lifeboat of a boyfriend, clinging like she has never clung before, which only confirms and makes realer this fear; and so the water rises again and she clings harder and harder until the two are both sunk. Maybe. Or maybe the Woman in Love was inside of her all along. The locusts return. Destiny appears by the nightstand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe man from the liquor store barreled into my boutique the other night with a bottle of bubbly for seduction. <i>All women are crazy,</i> he announced. He then enticed me with a tale about how his brainy girlfriend of four years just dumped him because, she claimed, she felt like she was becoming submissive and losing her sense of self. <i>Weak sauce</i> was his verdict, <i>the relationship changed me too\u2014that\u2019s what relationships do.</i> Maybe he had a point: maybe their partnership was solid and it was simply some fear of becoming submissive\u2014of becoming just like all those other infinite, faceless women\u2014that led her to misinterpret any sacrifices or shifts as spelling out doom. Or perhaps the insects laid their eggs inside her, too.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI linger on de Beauvoir\u2019s \u201cjustifications\u201d because it is shocking, sometimes laugh-out-loud hilarious, how relevant <i>The Second Sex</i> still feels. I have been so sick and tired of hearing the sound of my voice repeat the same threadbare stories and act out the same conviction-less roles that I have been reduced to silence. I have uttered pathetic lines like <i>I would be happy to make you a sandwich every day for the rest of my life</i> [and have that be it] and have then punished myself by believing these words. I do not believe that I am alone. It is not necessary for me to repeat anecdotes about women I know who have acted out the Narcissist or the Woman in Love; I am sure that you, reader, can easily round up examples. Certainly, one need not be female to engage in narcissism or self-immolating love but I do believe that the soul-destroying, crazy-making extremity of these games strikes intelligent, independent girls harder than it strikes smart boys. What begins as a healthy diet plunges into that creepy-woman disease, anorexia. To find the person that one is truly in love with breaks the glass between one and the world, one finally honestly cares and loves the world unselfishly and this is a precious gift from God but it is fragile and quickly warps, plummets into a bitter suicide. An invigorating dose of self-doubt morphs into a distracting degree of self-deprecation or crippling bouts of anxiety. I believe that these days the extremity comes\u2014perhaps consciously, perhaps not\u2014from the sensation that whenever a woman has an ugly feeling, there is the guilt of feeling that she is a weak female, and then the double-guilt for feeling the former; the shame that accompanies this layering magnifies the initial ugly feeling and leads the woman to punish herself by wallowing in the ugliness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I say that I do not believe that I am alone although I have yet to speak to other women about the matter. This does not deter me from my suspicions: part of what marks shame as shame (and makes the whole mess messier) is the secrecy involved. Cockroaches, again. My college roommate and I, too jumpy to kill, used to trap a roach in a Mason jar and let it starve slowly on the living room floor. At the worst of it, there would be several jars scattered in that abandoned room\u2014it would take one roach weeks to die. At times, one would lie inert, we would think it dead: perhaps she felt the lonesomeness of dying in a sharp searing, the stomach gnaws at herself. But mostly one continued to scrabble up and down the glass walls as one did the city streets, witnessing the hideous bellies of others. It is shameful to watch but you could not reach if you tried, and you know you look exactly the same but it does not feel like that, and so we continue: gathered together, separated by glass, twitching in our bell jars. \r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><img src= \"/media/images/8/anna.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Wesley Clapp</i></center></p> \r\n<p>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I remember asking that roommate and another lady friend if they were interested in feminism. It was after a summer spent boozing with queer San Francisco anarchists in Oaxaca and for once, the shame and anxiety I felt towards my relation to being female had turned to anger; I wanted it to stay like that, and was hungry for advocates. But soon after I returned to campus my blood once again became watery and I would quake at the thought of projecting my voice; needless to say, asking about feminism felt like an embarrassing question. And they responded like it was an embarrassing question, or perhaps a dumb one. <i>No,</i> said the aesthete. <i>No,</i> said the Africanist. The gist: feminism had killed herself; there were smarter and sexier theories it had birthed; their mothers worked and they got great grades, so why would they consider feminism? Fair enough. The only self-proclaimed feminists I knew were men but most of them ended up being interested in queer theory, which sounded nice but was ten steps ahead of me and not the kind of personal, honest conversation that I sought. I felt too female, too weak, to approach the strangers that I knew called themselves feminists; I figured that they would not like me. I was probably right. I considered enrolling in a gender theory class but backed off when I heard the rumor that the renowned female professor hated most women.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <i>And that is why I wish I wasn\u2019t a woman:</i> words from my ultra-tough super-smart friend when I told her that ladies who entered my store were reduced to middle-schoolers, squealing over cashmere.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPerhaps it is the sorry plight of the privileged girl who gets thrown into a scene hung-up on intellectualism: we are too privileged to have explored the feminist bit; we, like proper intellectuals-in-training, eagerly pick apart every feeling or fleeting thought that sifts into the mind; we enjoy being spread out onto the chaise lounge so he can practice psycho-analysis. As a result, we know to scorn all the shallow and weak feminine marks that were intaglioed into our bodies some time long, long ago; scorn but have yet to erase these marks; we feel the secrecy of our shame, then we, internally, question why we scorn and are shamed and question that and question questioning questioning and question questioning questioning questioning questioning and so on and so forth until the weight of the emptiness of the hole that anxiety bores into our being is enough to make us _____________.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>***</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nBecause the fear of feminine weakness is not satisfied gnawing away at one\u2019s own mind but chomps down the rest of the world. I meet a great girl who is smart and confident and then I catch a glimpse of her legs: they are grossly skinny; she is weak; she is a liar. I find out that a friend I desperately admire has suffered from an eating disorder, or has been wiped out by a boy: instead of acting like a friend, I feel disgusted and betrayed; I run away. If a girl\u2019s legs are just right and seems like just the kind of girl I would want to hang around, then I assume that she would not understand me and would hate me, so I keep my distance. I am distrustful of most men for the regular reasons but mostly I am jealous because they can cook and be weak and vain without it all burning a hole in their head.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBooks will be devoured, too. One time after fleeing from a masochistic relationship with the false prophet I did what I tend to do when I am tired of how it always ends: I tried to love Him. I buried myself in Simone Weil and was truly blown away by the passion of her writing and the truth behind her ideas but when I discovered that she had starved herself to death (and it could not matter how complex or noble were her motives), her words suddenly lost all value. Simply another weak female with the weak female disease rambling in her soapbox diaries. Even de Beauvoir was unable to escape unscathed. I read <i>The Mandarins</i> and suddenly all her liberating theory seemed like a pretty lie; there she was getting old as Sartre went out and fucked younger women and she has to go all the way to the U.S. to sleep with a scummy jazz musician just so she can prove her theory is right and she is free and equal and all that but the whole time she hates it and feels old and sad and pathetic.\r\n</p> \r\n<p>\r\nFed up with women who come off as having transcended the hellish bodiliness of the female but clearly have not, I turned towards Mary Gaitskill, who once slipped the word <i>soul</i> into an interview before correcting herself, claiming that soul was\u00a0too big of a word for her. \u00a0Her <i>Two Girls, Fat and Thin</i> is chock-full of vivid descriptions of the two protagonists mistaking their bodies for their beings and being nauseatingly <i>female.</i> There is Justine, who at eleven begins to learn that the sex of her body grants her access to participate in the outside world:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>Sometimes glamorous older boys would follow [Justine and her posse] saying \u2018I\u2019d like to pet your pussy\u2019 and other dirty things; this was exciting, like the poem about the crucified man, only it made her feel queasier as it was real and in public. It was horrible to be in front of people having the same feeling that she had while masturbating and thinking about torture. She was sure that Edie and Pam didn\u2019t have feelings like that; probably they didn\u2019t even masturbate. They blushed and giggled and said \u2018You guys better stop it\u2019 but they swung their purses and arched their backs, their eyes half-closed and their lips set in lewd, malicious smiles. Justine would imitate them, and when she did, sometimes a door would open and she\u2019d step into a world where it was really very chic to walk around in public with wet underpants, giggling while strange boys in leather jackets and pointed shoes called you a slut. The world of Justine alone under the covers with her own smells, her fingers stuck in her wet crotch, was now the world of the mall filled with fat, ugly people walking around eating and staring. It was a huge world without boundaries; the clothes and record and ice cream stores seemed like cardboard houses she could knock down, the waddling mothers and pimple-faced loners like dazed pedestrians she was passing on a motorcycle.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd there is fat Dotty who feels fullness and the truth of herself by being swallowed in the hatred of her body, which she finds in the mirror:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nI went into the bathroom and turned on the light and took off my shirt to stare at and hate my body. There were pimples on my chest and I welcomed them, wishing they were boils or scars, anything to more fully degrade this body... I had the fleeting thought that my roommate could come home at any minute, and I hoped she would so that I could display the truth of how loathsome I was and feel her contempt as well as my own.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThe passion with which I first hated Gaitskill\u2019s novel was of the variety that I generally reserve for those closest to me. I jumped up and down, screeching at the boyfriend who had recommended it that the book was <i>trash, utter trash,</i> before he quieted me by asking why I insisted on using that peculiar word, <i>trash?</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><i>Trash:</i> to be thrown in the dump and not looked back on. <i>Trash:</i> un-ironically low-brow; undeserving of serious attention. <i>Trash:</i> all of my weaknesses and markedly feminine qualities that I have tried desperately to bury because if I am a woman living in an age that has supposedly surpassed feminism and I know better than to fall into traps and am still having weak thoughts that I pin to my femaleness then I must be weak and I must not utter these thoughts out loud for they are undeserving: trash.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI do not want this piece of writing to be unapproachable. I do not want a reader\u2019s reaction to be, this-is-a-touchy-subject-that-I-cannot-understand, so-I-will-approach-it-like-a-train-wreck, with distance. At the same time, I am so fed up of so many contemporary female writers\u2014with females in general, myself included\u2014who fear coming off as untouchable, and so hide their weaknesses or broach them (in their writings, with their friends) from a safe, face-saving distance (employing the very-past tense and/or cutting a weighty line with self-deprecation are two popular methods of creating distance).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is for this reason that I would like to end with a nod to Mary Gaitskill, who is the first reputable contemporary female author that I have come across who enters into the brutal, painstakingly female psychologies of her subjects and refuses to leave. Her <i>Two Girls, Fat and Thin</i> mimics <i>The Second Sex</i> in this regard: following her women from childhood to adulthood; and the women do not get to cast off all their ugly feelings just because they learn that these feelings are ugly and weak. There is no distance: reading Gaitskill is unbearable; it makes a girl explode.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no space to breathe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trash: what could that become, creating trash with words? <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

Fear of Irony</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou may recall a meme which made the rounds in the weeks after 9/11: the claim that the fall of the Twin Towers had \u201ckilled irony.\u201d The Atlantic recently published <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/national/2011/09/death-irony-and-its-many-reincarnations/42298/\">a helpful investigation</a> into the origins of that strange idea, but it seems to have become so ubiquitous so quickly that a definitive attribution is impossible\u2014as though the entire commentariat had been eagerly awaiting an opportunity to sign irony\u2019s death-warrant with the usual mixture of moralistic harangue and manifest glee.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSuch unanimity demands investigation. If there\u2019s an urtext here, it\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000893,00.html#ixzz1XTdJiGt1\">Roger Rosenblatt\u2019s distasteful editorial</a>, published in Time on September 24, 2001, in which he purports to find a bright side to 9/11: \u201cOne good thing could come from this horror: it could spell the end of the age of irony.\u201d According to Rosenblatt, in the decades before 9/11 we-as-a-culture believed that \u201cnothing was real.\u201d But no more! 9/11 was the Real Thing, the authentic encounter, the one that puts all efforts at detachment to shame: \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\u201cHistory occurs twice, crack the wise guys quoting Marx: first as tragedy, then as farce. Who would believe such a thing except someone who has never experienced tragedy? Are you looking for something to take seriously? Begin with evil. The fact before our eyes is that a group of savage zealots took the sweet and various lives of those ordinarily traveling from place to place, ordinarily starting a day of work or\u2014extraordinarily\u2014coming to help and rescue others. Freedom? That real enough for you? Everything we cling to in our free and sauntering country was imperiled by the terrorists. Destruction was real; no hedging about that.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRosenblatt\u2019s ironist tries to escape the basic facts of life (death, destruction), but perhaps more importantly its basic values (freedom, good and evil) through some sort of amused detachment, what he calls irony. The destruction of the World Trade Center, while in many ways an unfortunate event, does have the virtue of kicking the purveyors of this effete and irresponsible attitude in the face and, as it were, screaming (in Rosenblatt\u2019s voice, of course): \u201cWho\u2019s funny now, punk? Huh? Who\u2019s laughing now?!\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut who exactly is this ironist attacked here? The answer is a strange one: Rosenblatt, the Harvard professor, best-selling author and Time magazine columnist, blames a wicked cultural elite. It is \u201cour chattering classes\u2014our columnists and pop culture makers,\u201d \u201cthe good folks in charge of America's intellectual life,\u201d who have perpetrated this desecration of our values. The ironist is a threat not so much from within as from above: the aristocrat possessing the luxury of distance from Real Things like death and freedom.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n   Of course, this attack on an unnamed \u201celite\u201d is standard fare among American conservatives, and has been for decades; our culture is always being undermined from within by a decadent Fifth Column of relativistic liberals, just as it is always under attack from the teeming and amoral brown masses from without. But whence the rich and deeply felt resentment for something as apparently innocuous as a sense of humor? The question is all the more pressing since it goes without saying that irony has never been the dominant force in a culture which watches Oprah religiously and turns Nick Hornby bestsellers into major motion pictures every couple of years. The idea of the ironist as omnipotent, dissolving cultural force is manifestly more hysterical projection than empirical fact. But what is the nature of this projection? What, precisely, is the threat of the ironist?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRosenblatt\u2019s piece offers a partial answer to this question: the ironist robs us of the pleasure of direct identification. To give oneself over entirely to the self-congratulation of freedom, the shared assault on an \u201cevil\u201d enemy, even the sentimentality of public, mediatized mourning: these are very great pleasures, but to appreciate them one must avoid certain forms of reflective consciousness.<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup> Rosenblatt\u2019s decision to project this disidentified consciousness onto an imagined other is scarcely surprising\u2014how else to exorcize such a threat from within? But he and the dozens of op-ed columnists who quoted him might have chosen several enemies for this purpose; the leftist intellectual, for example, always problematizing concepts like \u201cnation\u201d and \u201cfreedom,\u201d might have been declared dead. Such people seem a good bit more threatening at first glance than the ironist, who after all takes nothing seriously. So why go after irony?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>2. The Fantasmatic Hipster</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nIn contemporary youth culture, the hipster is the ironic figure par excellence. But the hipster comes in two forms, and here we must make a distinction.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe empirical hipster was originally a figure of the late 1990s, geographically localized (the Lower East Side, Williamsburg) and possessed of clear cultural markers (trucker hats, suburban-cheesy T-shirts). These cultural markers have mostly gone the way of all fashions, and term has broadened to the point of uselessness as a sub-cultural marker: as an empirical category, \u201chipster\u201d denotes something much closer to a class position (white, urban, lots of cultural capital but not too much cash) than a genuine cultural category. The strange history of this term, and the ways in which it has eaten or been eaten by the mainstream of youth culture, begs for investigation\u2014but it need not concern us here.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn our pursuit of the question of irony, we must address not the empirical hipster but his double, the fantasmatic hipster\u2014the hipster whom everyone despises, or used to despise. While the concept of the empirical hipster is nebulous to the point of evanescence, that of the fantasmatic hipster is remorselessly concrete. He is, first off, a consumer, not a creator: he appropriates the fashions of yesteryear rather than inventing his own, curates his LP collection instead of releasing mixtapes, critiques the art of the past instead of producing something new. Yet in his appropriative activity he displays no genuine admiration for the past he pilfers, not even true antiquarian zeal; his consumption is distanced, inauthentic. His relation to the cultural signifiers he adopts hovers in the ambiguous zone between identification and mockery.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe worst of it, though, is that the hipster thinks all this makes him cooler than you. His recherch\u00e9 cultural knowledge is a source of strange power. By the time you fall in love with a band, it\u2019s already \u201cover\u201d for him; scarcely have you found a neat ethnic neighborhood when he opens a vintage boutique there. The hipster is a figure of knowledge, not love, and he always knows a bit more than you. The hipster is the person in whom knowledge has overtaken pure, unselfconscious enjoyment\u2014pleasure has become taste, authenticity has been buried under self-aestheticization.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one sense, the hipster is to my generation what the poser was to the punk. The poser, too, shows up late to the scene of other people\u2019s creativity and brings nothing to it, appropriating artistic authenticity and political commitment as mere fetishized style and consumption. The poser, too, is a projection, the product of punk\u2019s quixotic attempt to link pop music with an ethic of personal authenticity and an anti-establishment politics. Some such effort has characterized a strand of American youth culture for decades now, and when it doesn\u2019t work out\u2014when music culture turns out to be a kind of fashion, and fashion turns out to be a kind of consumption\u2014the poser, the enemy from without, must take the fall.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut the politics of anti-consumerist authenticity has lost much of its power by now\u2014its last martyr, Kurt Cobain, died of its contradictions in 1994\u2014and the figure of the hipster portends something different. If attacks on the hipster, particularly on his lack of political engagement, hark back to punk with a certain nostalgia, the hipster as we\u2019ve described him nevertheless portends something new\u2014both more insidious and more interesting. The poser, after all, was always susceptible to the charge that he was a poser: he aped the authenticity of the \u201creal\u201d punks and had to pretend he wasn\u2019t faking it. Hipsters are different: one can\u2019t very well tell a hipster in a trucker hat that he isn\u2019t \u201creally\u201d a trucker. That he isn\u2019t, and knows he isn\u2019t, and wears it anyway, is precisely what makes him a hipster.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe hipster as hated occupies a place in the psychology of his detractors strikingly homologous to that of the ironic purveyors of culture in Rosenblatt\u2019s imagination: he is a member of a self-appointed elite which, armed with all too much knowledge, disrupts unselfconscious identification and its pleasures. And just as the supposed ironic cultural elite permits Rosenblatt to paint his refusal of critical thought as rebellion against a dominant culture, the hipster as an enemy permits \u201cpost-ironic\u201d sentimentality to think itself daring. And in both cases, the central concept in the polemic is\u2014irony.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. The Continuity of Socratic Irony with that of the Hipster</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat, then, is irony? Here as elsewhere an investigation of origins can help. Etymology Online provides us with <a href=\"http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=irony&searchmode=none\">the following definition</a>: \r\n<blockquote>irony :\r\nc.1500, from L. ironia, from Gk. eironeia, from eiron \"dissembler,\" perhaps related to eirein \"to speak.\u201d Used in Greek of affected ignorance, especially that of Socrates. For nuances of usage, see humor.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything about this entry is suggestive, and first of all its reference to Socrates. (The very fact that to trace the origins of this word one must refer to a proper name is entirely characteristic.) Let us consider the activity of Socrates in its simplest form to see how well it accords with the definition given.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSome blowhard comes along and Socrates asks what justice is and the blowhard answers with a smirk that everyone knows what justice is, why, it\u2019s such and such! And Socrates says something like: \u201cHow right you are, my dear friend, and how fortunate <i>I</i> am to have come across someone who knows all about this highest virtue! Yet I remain in the dark on one small point\u2014do enlighten me...\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSocrates, of course, is being ironic. Why, exactly? Well, first off, his speech is in some sense deceptive, an affectation of ignorance. Socrates knows very well that this fool hasn\u2019t a clue what justice is, and that after five or six rounds of questioning he\u2019ll scarcely know which way is up. Socrates\u2019 pretension to ignorance is merely a siren\u2019s song, tempting him out onto the rocks.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut it\u2019s a strange sort of dissemblance, because certainly no one is deceived: the Athenians knew as well as we do that Socrates\u2019 protestations of ignorance and admiration were not to be relied on. The blowhard is being mocked from the outset and will be humiliated in the end.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIs what we have arrived at\u2014the pretense of ignorance announcing itself as pretense, used to mock the interlocutor\u2014an adequate definition of irony as the Platonic Socrates used it? Hardly. What we have defined, tellingly enough, is sarcasm. When you say, in response to some fool\u2019s suggestion, \u201cOh, that\u2019s a <i>great</i> idea\u2014why hadn\u2019t I thought of <i>that</i>?\u201d, you\u2019re making a pretense to ignorance whose tone shows it to be a pretense, in order to mock the one you\u2019re addressing\u2014and you\u2019re being sarcastic, not ironic. You\u2019re also being impolite. Socrates was never impolite.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHow was Socrates different? The answer is clear: While he pretended to be ignorant, Socrates <i>really didn\u2019t know</i>. He hadn\u2019t a clue what justice was. This doesn\u2019t render his speech sincere, of course: he knew a good deal more than his interlocutors, and was aware of this. But all he knew was their shared ignorance. The biting contrast which characterizes sarcasm is replaced by a more ambiguous distance. Sarcasm works by measuring out the distance between what is said (\u201cthat\u2019s a great idea!\u201d) and the truth (\u201cthat\u2019s the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard\u201d); irony works much more subtly, by measuring out the distance between here and nowhere. In sarcasm the truth is present, made manifest through its negation; in Socratic irony, the truth is absent.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe relationship between all this and trucker hats should be clear, but let me be explicit. Suppose you\u2019re listening to Ke$ha\u2019s hit single, \u201cTik Tok.\u201d You may be listening to it sincerely, because <i>you too</i> brush your teeth with a bottle of Jack, though I suspect such sincere listeners are figments of the curmudgeonly cultural critic\u2019s imagination. You may be listening to it sarcastically\u2014mocking all the people who you imagine sincerely identify with this vision of the night life. (You self-satisfied douchebag, you.) But very likely you\u2019re listening to it the way both I and my mother do: with an ambiguous savor of self-consciousness, a certain distance from the pleasures it describes, in short, a tad ironically. Similarly with trucker hats: you may be idealizing blue-collar culture with the grim, foolish sincerity of, say, Norman Mailer in \u201cThe White Negro,\u201d or you may be mocking this culture from the comfortable position of class privilege. But most likely your position is harder to pin down: you sure as hell aren\u2019t a trucker, but you aren\u2019t exactly not one either: you desire the affinity and reference without quite making it your own.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOf course, merely wearing something you aren\u2019t isn\u2019t enough to render you ironic. Socrates doesn\u2019t just say stuff he doesn\u2019t know\u2014that\u2019s his interlocutors\u2019 job. Rather, it is the <i>consciousness</i> of this ambiguity\u2014the consciousness of an ambiguous distance between what one seems to be and a supposed but absent actuality\u2014which generates the peculiar pleasures of irony. Socrates and the modern \u201cironic\u201d share precisely this consciousness, and precisely this pleasure.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe difference, of course, is that Socrates is a pure case\u2014he resolutely and continuously knows absolutely nothing, right up to the day of his death. Whereas we modern ironists\u2014and very few of us these days fail to make use of irony one way or another\u2014find ourselves on a gradient; we\u2019re ironic without quite knowing nothing. Our fashions and poses are masks at times, and we know this, but we still suspect that behind the mask there\u2019s a face.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\nSection 4: Fear of Irony</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat is it that\u2019s threatening about the ambiguous distance of irony? We might learn a bit about this from the fate of Socrates. It is well known that Socrates\u2019 irony got him followers among the best of the Athenian youth, and that it also got him killed in the end. What\u2019s easy to miss is that these two consequences stem from much the same source: the misunderstanding proper to irony.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAt his trial, Socrates was accused of \u201crefusing to recognise the gods acknowledged by the state, and importing strange divinities of his own; \u2026 [and] of corrupting the young.\" (This according to Xenophon.) Which is strange, when you think about it, because Socrates didn\u2019t preach <i>anything</i>\u2014least of all a new religion. In the <i>Apology</i>, Plato has him point this out: he was and remains ignorant. Would it not have been more natural for the Athenians to accuse him of being an atheist and a nihilist, a know-nothing cynic of the kind so ubiquitous in the Greco-Roman world?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn the contrary, no one could mistake an ironist for a cynic. Both know nothing, to be sure\u2014but the cynic announces his position in plain words for all to see. The ironist begs the question and leaves it begging. Socrates never found out what virtue was, but he did not cease to ask: he kept his ignorance always in play. For the cynic, non-knowledge is a closed door, but Socrates held it open. This was what made him so destructive and convincing: his interlocutors were sucked toward him by the force of his ignorance, and their knowledge disappeared into the black hole behind his irony.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGiven this, the accusations against him begin to make sense: the Athenians saw, quite correctly, that there was something \u201cbehind\u201d the facade of ironic ignorance. Irony always asks the question as to what truth it veils and refers to. Innocents that they were, the Athenian people could only imagine that some new religion was at work here, could only hypostatize as a new form of knowledge what in truth was just infinite ignorance.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSocrates\u2019 enemies were not alone in seeking something behind his mask. Alcibiades, in his ode of love and hate for Socrates in the <i>Symposium</i>, compares the man to a clay statue, ugly in appearance, which, when cracked open, reveals the most beautiful treasures. All his talk is faintly ridiculous, but behind it there is <i>something else</i>. This something else evokes in Alcibiades a lust more intense than he has felt for any other man\u2014yet when he tries to seduce Socrates, he fails utterly. He\u2019s driven to the lengths of making his offer explicit: he will give himself to Socrates in exchange for wisdom. To which Socrates of course replies with amused irony that if Alcibiades were right and he possessed wisdom, he\u2019d be making a very foolish exchange (since what is sex compared to wisdom, after all?) but that Alcibiades, of course, is quite mistaken: Socrates knows nothing. This Alcibiades refuses to believe.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe begin to understand the corrosive effect of irony. Irony announces itself as a mask, but refuses to confess what it is masking. Accuse it of bad faith, ill will, nihilism or emptiness: it doesn\u2019t have much to answer, but it retains an open question. This refusal to be concrete produces a hunger for the concrete, a longing to unmask\u2014a hunger which can take the form of love and even idolatry, as in Alcibiades\u2019 case, but can also take the form of hatred.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThose who believed that 9/11 must surely destroy irony believed the encounter with death would show us who we really are, that terror would burn away all masks and force us (us ironists) to subscribe to the creed of Freedom. They believed in an identity and an identification which would be absolute and inescapable\u2014and called everything else hypocrisy. To the ironist, though, every statement is a hypothesis for debate, every self-fashioning a faintly laughable choice; this politics of the undeniable self, this ethic of authenticity, is one such choice among others. I would not want to claim that the ironic position is in itself political\u2014our society allows endless opportunities for ironic self-fashioning which leave it entirely unchanged. Irony is even the ideal position of the consumer in modern society\u2014the person who must assemble an identity out of images purveyed in ad campaigns, who doesn\u2019t of course believe the ads but doesn\u2019t have much else to go on. Still, against those who seek to center a politics squarely on the true self, and would portray the absence of such a self as a form of bad faith, one really must side with the ironists.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nThe Onion captured this idea well in its headline last week, \u201cNation Would Rather Think About 9/11 Than Anything from Subsequent Ten Years.\u201d\r\n</p>",

The promise of any number of miracle diets:  \u201cHave all your favorite foods and don\u2019t gain a pound!\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the present age of digital reproduction and transmission, it is less and less the case that we have to eat in order to consume: that we have to acquire objects, get materially fatter and bigger, in order to absorb information and meaning (Grooveshark instead of CDs, Wikipedia instead of encyclopedias, e-books, etc.). Indeed, works of art (which I will conceive broadly to include meaning-carrying works of varying form and size\u2013essays, blog posts, news articles, videos, tweets) are less and less like material products that we consume like a loaf of bread or a cigarette, to the point where the concept of \u201cconsumption\u201d hardly applies to them.  We can see what is new about digital reproduction by examining three aspects of it:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n1.  Reproduction.  Once an object exists, it may be copied and transmitted (reproduced) virtually effortlessly, costlessly.  This itself causes a change in how we as users treat the object.  The object has no aura; there is no distance between us and it; we do not need to treat it with reverence\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n2.  The act of consumption.  Nor does consumption cost anything in either of the traditional ways.  On one hand, the user does not have to pay anything for use of the object, does not have to give up anything of him/herself.  And on the other hand, the user does not take anything out of the world by using the object.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n3.  The result of consumption.  Since in consuming the object we do not take anything out of it, it is only logical that nothing is added to us.  Consumption does not fill us or satisfy our hunger.  On the contrary, it stimulates hunger.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Digital Reproduction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1936, Walter Benjamin predicted that mechanical reproduction of artworks would lead to the destruction of their \u201caura,\u201d the phenomenon of distance between the viewer and the unique artwork<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup>\r\n. It is connected with the cult value of the object, its religious or magical power. Contrast internet memes: we sense a particular quality or power in them, but it must consist somehow in the memes\u2019 reproducedness, their effortless spread/sprawl.  Rather than being unique and distant they turn up everywhere, right in front of us.  What amazes us is their closeness and ubiquity; we don\u2019t even need to seek them out.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMechanical reproduction is like the mating of livestock.  Cattle are a mass commodity; one is replaceable with another.  So in the conception and birth of a calf there is not the unique creative act, no intention of some genius to admire, that is present in even in the simplest sketch or worst poem: \u201cSomeone imagined this and made it real.\u201d But there is still what is called a miracle of life, a creation of life out of the struggle of other life.  Living matter combines and expends some of itself in order to put another piece of matter into the motion that is life.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDigital reproduction of a file is like (how perceptive our terminology!) the reproduction of a virus.  It is an active question whether viruses qualify as biological life.  Viruses hardly have bodies: they are an envelope of information, instructions.  It requires a separate living cell with its own organelles and nutrients to read those instructions and reproduce the virus.  New viruses are not even made out of the bodies of other viruses.  The virus is not a continuity of substance but only of a pattern or configuration.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus the digital reproduction of an artwork comes closer to the direct spread of an idea or a thought.  Works of art more and more resemble directly the weightless immaterial thought.  We can only logically tolerate that they <i>don\u2019t</i> (in concept) obey physical laws if (in concept) they are not <i>physical.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe talk of the \u201cspread of ideas\u201d through the spread of books, as if we could tune out the physical dimension and see only the movement of mental entities between minds.  We would see only thoughts moving from mind to mind, no nasty fingers and eyes to obstruct and complicate the view.  But in reality an idea could only travel by hitching a ride on some pile of wood pulp and pigments, and could only enter into another mind through the service entrance that is the nervous system.  Now they have been granted a terrain of their own on which to walk freely.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Consumption</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When we eat a steak and say a prayer to the cow\u2019s spirit, there is still a certain respect for the sacred, a distance maintained even up to the moment of ingestion, in contrast to the complete elimination of distance by the surgeon.  In these cases our body is a temple, and a creature that is sacrificed in it must receive its proper rites.  Contrast to things we think of as mass-produced, faceless, unlimited: fish sticks, Cheetos, popcorn.  Nothing, as far as we\u2019re usually concerned, had to die in order for us to enjoy these things, no persistent object led a long independent life whose fate ends with us.  The difference in quality or prestige between a steak and a Cheeto is not the point, as we could well consider a contrived pop song on LP vs. a genius and innovative musical piece on Youtube.  The point is that except for a few cents worth of electricity, which surely does not cross our mind, it does not cost anyone anywhere anything for us to listen to that BitTorrented Helmut Walcha rendition of Bach\u2019s Trio Sonatas.  It is a free thing in the universe.<sup><a name=\"id2\" href=\"#ft2\">2</a></sup>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are other things that we don\u2019t respect as food yet expect to nourish us. Multivitamins;  energy drinks;  meal-replacement bars or shakes.  All presume in some way to produce health and continued life without the ritual of eating, without the bodily work that demands respect of both the object and our own consuming body.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBenjamin said that for the film there is no aura, no distance.  At least with films you have to set up, have some sort of ritual, buy admission.  With digital reproduction there is no cost at all.   And if we do not have to put labor into obtaining the product, then to us it is much less a mass of congealed labor.  Besides, would not whatever labor value is in the article be divided among every copy and so be effectively zero?  These are silly questions though, as most  internet content is profitable on a quite different model, namely through the sale of advertisements (there are other models including subscription and outright purchase, but the advertisement model is paradigmatic).  The website providing content is paid by advertisers to stimulate desire and subsequent consumption of the advertiser\u2019s product (or, recursively, the advertiser may be another advertisement-funded website, paying the first site to divert traffic to it so that its advertisements may be viewed).  Benjamin distinguished between the cult value<sup><a name=\"id3\" href=\"#ft3\">3</a></sup> and the exhibition value of an artwork, and saw that a mechanically reproduced artwork retains no cult value and all of its value must be exhibition value. Digitally reproduced content also must depend exclusively on exhibition value.\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Still Hungry</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nBenjamin noted, \u201cThe film is the first art form capable of demonstrating how matter plays tricks on man.\u201d Digital \u201cun\u201dmatter has its own tricks.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt\u2019s generally true of miracle diets that in the end they don\u2019t work, they are no substitute for real food.  (If they do achieve their intended effects, it\u2019s likely that they take their toll on the dieter\u2019s health in other ways.)  When we listen to a song on Grooveshark, are we less satisfied, less nourished than we would be by a live performance or a physical recording?  One thing that is said about the music industry in the internet age is that the most successful, well-adapted artists are those who can give away their music for free and actively tour, so that the reproductions generate desire for the cult value of the live performance.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo we can say this: digital objects no longer fill us, but rather make us hungry. Another way to put this is that digital content is more an advertisement than a product.  Is this unqualifiedly true of all digital content?  Don\u2019t the dozens of articles we read online satisfy the desire for entertainment or up-to-date knowledge that brings us to them?  But the satisfaction of an appetite is not the same thing as nourishment.  Knowing what is going on in the world is at most a preparation for going into the world and doing things there.  We read about political events in order to later take informed political action; even when that action is little more than having a conversation about it or making different purchases, that action is where the consummation takes place.  This was true of mass-produced print material too, but not nearly to the same extent.  The internet comes substantially closer to being a mirror of the world, a second version of it.  The more this is the case, the easier it can be to confuse watching the world with living in it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is in a way a trick, though there is no need to think of it as devious as long as the things we get hungry for are good things to eat, and we eat them.  We have unparalleled resources with which to craft our hunger.  But we would be complicit in a terrible trick on ourselves if we didn\u2019t recognize what we were really hungry for, or if we thought that the things making us hungrier were in fact feeding us.  This happens sometimes, and we begin to starve.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\" />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\">\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nBenjamin describes an object\u2019s aura as \u201cthe quality of its presence\u2026a most sensitive nucleus\u2014namely, its authenticity\u2026The authenticity of a thing is the essence of all that is transmissible from its beginning, ranging from its substantive duration to its testimony to the history which it has experienced.\u201d  He later defines the aura as \u201cthe unique phenomenon of distance, however close it may be.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft2\" href=\"#id2\">2</a></sup>\r\nWe might occasionally think things like \u201cThe creators of YouTube were brilliant,\u201d or \u201cThank God someone recorded this so that we have it today.\u201d But note the \u201cwe\u201d\u2013we are thankful on behalf of humanity, which now holds this artwork in common. In essence we are glad that this artwork survived the long dark ages to our civilized times in which anything once produced is available to everyone forever.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft3\" href=\"#id3\">3</a></sup>\r\n\u201cThe uniqueness of a work of art is inseparable from its being imbedded in the fabric of tradition\u2026Originally the contextual integration of art in tradition found its expression in the cult. We know that the earliest art works originated in the service of a ritual\u2014first the magical, then the religious kind. It is significant that the existence of a work of art with reference to its aura is never entirely separated from its ritual function\u2026One may assume that what mattered [for objects used in ritual] was their existence, not their being on view.\u201d Exhibition value, on the other hand, is the value connected with an object's public presentability.  When a painting is placed in a museum, its exhibition value is emphasized.  A newspaper photograph has no value apart from the fact that it is seen. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nWe use the word \"reconstruction\" primarily in two senses: first, to describe specific historical periods\u2014the aftermath of a war, revolution, or regime change\u2014in other words the period following any massive destruction of industry, infrastructure and civic institutions in which the aforementioned are reconstructed. Capital flows in, infrastructure is rebuilt and new civic institutions are established. Reconstruction is typically construed progressively\u2014the reconstructed state is supposed to be free from the evils of the previous regime through the purging of loyalists, the improvement of corrupt institutions, etc.\u2014but we also know that these projects are either imperfectly carried out, or serve to mask more cynical economic interests\u2014the new regime must depend on the expertise of old-regime bureaucrats of questionable loyalty, and the lack of any strong institutions within a transitional state makes it vulnerable to exploitation by capitalists and rent-seekers alike.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe second sense of reconstruction refers not to history itself but to historiography: the determination of a past sequence of causes and effects based on partial evidence. Broadly construed, reconstruction is practiced not only by historians, but by criminal investigators, journalists and psychoanalysts. The only clues available to them are the traces of the past\u2014fingerprints at a crime scene, the testimony of unreliable witnesses, the parapraxes and symptoms of a neurotic patient\u2014and therefore the past must be reconstructed, the pieces must be put together into a plausible narrative account. The premise of the historian's work, and the work of the psychoanalyst, detective and journalist, is that collective memory, hearsay, and popular psychology are not good enough forms of understanding.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThese two reconstructive projects are inherently linked. The reconstruction of a country\u2014the purging of its past sins and corruptions\u2014demands a rewriting of history, a new way of thinking about that country's destiny, one that discards the triumphalist myths of the past in favor of a more humble and redemptive narrative. What happens to these discarded myths? Are they simply purged or overwritten, or do they, like the <i>ancien regime</i> technocrats, reinsert themselves into the daily life and political functioning of the newly reconstructed nation?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAssuming that politics is not possible without narrative, we can think of narrative art, and film in particular, as an attempt to determine new ways to conceptualize the politics of reconstruction. Whether the narrative possibilities of film are circumscribed by <i>a priori</i> limitations of medium or genre, or whether these possibilities remain infinitely open, is not a pertinent question because it presupposes a radical break between art and conceptual thought. Film is a valuable object of analysis because it attempts a reconstruction of the world that we live in, or in the case of a period film, of a world that no longer exists. It is thinking through the construction of a model\u2014the verisimilitude of the model standing in for the methodological rigor by which we judge the correctness of an idea. However, what is being tested is not the idea's scientific validity, its correspondence to a set of empirical data, but rather its narrative and aesthetic viability. This type of test is rather like trying on a suit of clothes. There are a number of standards by which the suit can be judged: comfort, conformity to dominant fashions, radical innovation. But while there is no single criterion, the reference point to which its quality is referred is always the human body on which it is worn. So in the same sense that there is a rigor proper to fashion, there is a rigor proper to cinema, construed loosely as a realistic narrative art form. This verisimilitude means the construction of a second reality\u2014a reality which must take as its touchstone a relation, however dialectical, to the \"real world.\" Period films may of course distort the past\u2014<i>Birth of a Nation</i> or <i>The Passion of the Christ</i> do so most offensively\u2014and what we take to be their success or failure has a lot to do with how accurate a picture they are giving us. We admire <i>Birth of a Nation</i> for its carefully constructed battle scene or <i>The Passion of the Christ</i> for the use of Aramaic (if you\u2019ll forgive the comparison), but cringe at their racist distortions of the historical record, and these reactions have a great deal to do with what we take to be the representational accountability of filmmaking.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn this third sense of the word, reconstruction means the limit point of representation\u2014the point at which representation becomes uncannily indistinguishable from repetition. Thus, for example, in Lars von Trier's first feature, <i>The Element of Crime,</i> the detective attempts a technique developed by his mentor of solving a crime by entering the psychology of a criminal\u2014staying in the same hotel rooms, sleeping with the same women, and ultimately committing the same crime (compare also <i>The Parallax View, La Jetee, Vertigo,</i> etc., all detective narratives in which the act of reconstruction becomes more than simply reconstruction). Or similarly, the Borgesian map that becomes as large as the world it is meant to depict. Or, in an example from real history, the \"German\" and \"Japanese\" cities constructed in Utah by the American military during World War II to test the effects of firebombing.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe distance between a narrative text and a narrative film cannot be overemphasized. The reader can choose how to represent each signifier in his mind's eye. In film, although the viewer may choose where to direct his gaze within the frame, wherever we look, the content has been provided for us. There are choices, to be sure\u2014the deeper the camera's focus is, for example, the more objects within the frame our eyes can scan and evaluate. The sensory plenum we are given within the movie theater allows for a maximum saturation of experience, and cinema is therefore able to both represent and include not only the film we are watching, but every other facet of the culture industry\u2014music, fashion, architecture, etc. Music, for example, is not merely an element of film\u2014an object of representation within film\u2014but is also a part of film, in the sense that when we listen to music in a film, we are not listening to a simulacrum of music or a representation of music, but to music itself, in exactly the same sense that we might listen to it on an iPod or record player.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTherefore, film as a form seems particularly well-suited to addressing the question of the past, since the past, we tend to believe, is primarily the sensual-cultural experience of it\u2014the experience of seeing the fashions, riding in an old automobile or horse-drawn carriage, listening to the music of the period. And it is this very way of experiencing the past that has come most heavily under fire by the contemporary critics of post-modernism. Fredric Jameson, most famously, criticizes the nostalgia film for portraying the past not as our past or as the past, but as a glossy spectacle whose realistic details serve the aims of popular consumption rather than a more authentic historical consciousness. Reconstruction here appears as a technological feat, and the past we are given in film is experienced less as a retrieval of our origins than as the crowning achievement of our present.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt would of course be reductive to claim that the possibilities for historical reconstruction are exhausted with the pastiche of the nostalgia film. And in his essay \"On Magical Realism in Film,\" Jameson offers an example from the Polish film <i>Fever</i> that illustrates one alternative mode of historical ontology in film: the visual depiction of the bomb that is the film's centerpiece.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nWhat is really striking. . . is not its appeal to any tactile sense, nor even the matter of color. . . : but rather the mint newness of this shiny metal object; and not even that, in and of itself, but rather the contradiction between this cleanness of oil on new metal and the old, the very old historical world in which the film is supposed to take place. As though somehow, in that ramshackle world of prerevolutionary Central Europe, you could not have new objects! And certainly not 'technology' in some contemporary science-and-industry sense! This confused thought\u2014the attempt to think a perception, really\u2014stages and intensifies the structural paradox of the historical novel in general: to read the past through a present of time, to live through a present marked as the past and the old, the dead and gone. So the film spins an impossible newness back upon us to confront us in bewilderment with the unthinkable conjunction between our own present in time and this ancient history: a point at which unaccountably, large drops of fresh blood fall slowly upon the cylinder, the camera slowly lifting to disclose the inventor licking a cut finger\u2014not the greatest danger of self-destruction, but a lesser one that merely has the onotological priority of being real. The drops of blood conjure a whole beyond of the tactile within the enormous two-dimensional image, transmuting the whorled pudginess of the stained fingers into this new visual realm. What results is not an Image, in the technical sense of derealization, but rather something else, which remains to be described, and which diverts a conventional narrative logic of the unfolding story in some new vertical direction, while working through its elements by way of the mediation of the body itself.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSo for Jameson, one mode of authentic reconstruction of the past is through the type of hyper-realism described by Benjamin in his essay \u201cThe Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,\u201d in which the hypnotic flow of everyday life is slowed down to the point where we are able to perceive it with greater acuity and critical attention. While most period films focus on capturing the \"rhythms\" of a given place or time, the technique described by Jameson goes precisely against that convention, since it is only by breaking with these rhythms that we are able to experience the past not as a closed cultural mode (rhythm, after all, is a synchronic rather than a diachronic phenomenon), but as an open historical moment. In <i>Brecht and Method</i>, Jameson claims that Benjamin's theories on film are an extension of the Brechtian use of intertitles, whose purpose is to break the dramatic narrative down into its component parts. Rather than a single continuous progression, we are able to see a series of individual and collective decisions\u2014and it is only through these discontinuities are we able to see how history might have taken another turn. This technique is used to great effect in Lars von Trier\u2019s film <i>Dogville,</i> in which there is a strong contrast between the stately Baroque music of the intertitles and the radical and horrific turns of plot wryly foreshadowed by the narrator.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nEach of the films of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's BRD trilogy, made between 1979 and 1981, takes on the problem of representing post-war German reconstruction, though each uses a radically different approach. <i>The Marriage of Maria Braun</i>, the first film of the trilogy, makes use of a more or less Brechtian or picaresque approach to narrative. While there are no intertitles, the plot (like that of the explicitly Brechtian <i>Berlin Alexanderplatz</i>) is strongly episodic, since each phase of Maria Braun's development is marked by a radical decision or rupture with the past in the course of her gradual maneuvering into the role of a wealthy executive in the newly reconstructed West German Republic. The irony here is that the one thing that remains constant through all these changes is her commitment to her husband, from whom she is separated first by the war and later after he confesses (falsely) to the murder of Maria's lover\u2014an irony because it is precisely by virtue of this weak but persistent marital link that we are able to see how much change Maria has undergone since the beginning of the film.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn <i>Lola,</i> the last film of the BRD trilogy, Fassbinder attempts a period film about German post-war reconstruction that not only reconstructs the German world of that era, but also does so in a filmic language of the post-war work of a German expat Hollywood director, Douglas Sirk. While the film's plot is inspired by Josef von Sternberg's <i>The Blue Angel</i>, stylistically, as with several of Fassbinder's other films, the primary reference point is Sirk's bright, candy-colored and gynocentric melodrama. <i>Lola,</i> like Sirk's melodramas, intervenes on both a personal and political level, dramatizing the often explosive tension between sexual desire, romantic love, and repressive social conventions. Here we have a mixture of irony and nostalgia, a nostalgia not for the fifties but for the fifties' most self-aware representation, a representation that addressed issues such as racial intolerance and class conflict in terms that we would now consider campy and overwrought.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAnd <i>Lola</i> itself is both campy and overwrought, but also, unlike Sirk's films, ultimately takes an ironic distance towards the emotional travails of its characters. The male protagonist of the film is Munich's new planning commissioner, von Bohm. Even before we see him, the mayor and the city's most powerful real estate developer are already discussing how to incorporate him into their profit-making schemes, a seemingly difficult task since he exhibits both an ingenuous conservative uprightness and a modern efficiency and conscientious attention to detail. In the evenings he plays the violin and studies Chinese art, and in his office he throws away the plants and girly pictures of his predecessor, replacing them with Calderesque mobiles and sleek modern furniture. Lola herself is a cabaret singer and prostitute, more or less the private whore of Schuckert, the developer. She learns about von Bohm from her mother, who is his housekeeper, from Schuckert, and from her friend Esslin, a pacifist intellectual and city hall functionary. They all speak of von Bohm as an extraordinary man, but express the conviction that Lola ought to have no interest in him. Lola, frustrated by the lack of respect implied in this judgment, decides that she will pursue von Bohm. A number of dramatic reversals ensue\u2014von Bohm proposes to Lola; Lola is afraid that von Bohm will not accept the fact she is a prostitute and stands him up on the day when he is to introduce her to the mayor, Schuckert and his housekeeper; von Bohm learns of Lola's profession and is devastated; von Bohm, with Esslin's help, tries and fails to prosecute the mayor for corruption; von Bohm returns to Lola\u2014as a customer\u2014but is too devastated to go through with the act, andat this point Lola realizes that he \"really loves her.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nVon Bohm is a highly problematic hero. His corny jokes and ingenuous attitude are charming, but also invite contempt. And we suspect that his moral behavior stems less from a real sense of right and wrong than from a kind of innate and habitual conservatism. Most interesting of all, his high-minded defense of the working class is limited to his period of wrath against Schuckert, the corrupt real estate developer who owns Lola. Once he marries Lola, he returns to his initial development-friendly attitudes. Lola remains Schuckert's mistress even after her marriage to von Bohm and thus elevates her own social position by ensuring amity between capital and government. She remains a prostitute, but now she has a much higher value. Significantly, as in many other Fassbinder works, we never see any true working-class characters; the idea of the working class plays a central but merely symbolic  role. While the films of Fassbinder's BRD trilogy are about economic reconstruction, the characters they concern are precisely not those participating as laborers in the industrial core of the new West German economy, but rather those working, or rather maneuvering, within the interstices of this economy. The drama is not the material work of reconstruction\u2014after all, work makes lousy drama\u2014but the more \"superstructural\" reconfigurations of power and social mores that take place during an era in which a great deal is up for grabs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt is in such a time of social upheaval that these alternate possibilities become open and that boundaries between social strata become most fluid. It is precisely the \"working class\" that is excluded from this fluidity, in which a prostitute might become a power broker and leftist intellectual might quit his city hall drudgery to gain employment with a real estate developer. Amid all these negotiations of power and ideology, loyalty to the working class is the first ideal to be sacrificed for the sake of harmony among the ruling elite. It is precisely this sort of compromise that is made in Brecht's <i>The Threepenny Opera,</i> in which the dramatic rescue of Macheath from the noose by the mounted messenger of the queen (the stage directions indicate that he is to be played by police chief Brown) is presented ironically as a pact between the criminal bourgeoisie and the powers of the state, a compromise that excludes, as the equally cynical and corrupt Peachum tells us, the \"poorest of the poor.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn <i>The Threepenny Opera</i> the drama reads ironically as the history of a pact or compromise, enacting on the surface the generic conventions of comic reconciliation, even as it draws attention subtly to those excluded from this pact. <i>Lola</i> is both a black comedy and black melodrama. In fact there are two endings. The penultimate scene shows us Schuckert and Lola, she still in her wedding dress, arriving at a high charged sexual reconciliation\u2014Lola is elated because finally Schuckert values her according to her true worth. \u201cNaked?\u201d she asks on her way to the bathroom. \u201cYes, but leave the veil on.\u201d \u201cThat's going to cost extra,\u201d Lola laughs, wagging her finger. Then, in the final scene, we see von Bohm walking through a meadow with the leftist intellectual Esslin and Lola's illegitimate daughter Marie, finally arriving at a little barn. Marie jumps up into the hayloft (the same hayloft where, earlier in the film, von Bohm and Lola first made love) and asks von Bohm if he is happy. The camera tracks to the left so that von Bohm's face is framed by the rungs of a ladder, symbolizing sexual imprisonment. Then a close-up. \u201cYes, Marie,\u201d he says. \u201cI am happy.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe film ends immediately, without final credits, as if it is these words themselves that magically cause the entire melodramatic world to implode or disappear. In the epilogue of <i>Berlin Alexanderplatz,</i> the narrator says that Franz Biberkopf has died and that now another man assumes his identity, and I think this moment may be interpreted as a similar rupture\u2014a point at which the inner substance of a man is destroyed and all that remains are his habits and mannerisms.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>* * *</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Lola</i> opens with Esslin reading a Rilke <a href = http://www.thebeckoning.com/poetry/rilke/rilke4.html>poem</a> to Lola in her dressing room: \"He who has no house shall not build one./ He who lives alone shall remain alone.\" \"Why does poetry always have to be sad? Why can't it be funny?\" asks Lola. \"Because poetry comes from the soul and the soul is sad.\" \"Why is the soul sad?\" \"Because it knows more than the mind.\" \"For me it's the other way around,\" says Lola. \"For me the mind knows more than the soul.\" This is a dreadfully confusing way to start the movie; after all, what does it mean for the soul to know something that the mind doesn't? And if such a thing is possible, how can the mind know something that the soul doesn't?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe placement of this scene at the beginning of the film suggests the presence of two basic oppositions at play\u2014between comedy and tragedy and between the soul and the mind. These dichotomies oppose two different generic classifications and two different modes of reception for the film, and the presence of these two sets of alternatives prevents us from impartially choosing either one. This lack of choice is the essence of Fassbinder's ironic style. In Jameson's characterization, Brecht's use of intertitles to divide dramatic action into its component parts is not as radical as the expansion of space and time called for in Benjamin's description of the potential of cinema, and exemplified by the depiction of the bomb in <i>Fever.</i> Fassbinder's <i>Lola</i> also radicalizes Brecht, but in the opposite direction. Instead of modifying the spatio-temporal dimensions of the classic Hollywood style, Fassbinder leaves these conventions more or less completely intact and introduces an element of contingency at the higher level of generic classification, by providing for us this initial choice between comedy and tragedy that remains explicitly unresolved. Because Lola and Esslin are equally unsympathetic characters\u2014Lola for her crassness and Esslin for his idealistic impotence and deep cynicism\u2014we are not permitted to fully enjoy the film either as a tragedy or as comedy, even though both these genres are fully deployed.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis ambivalent dramatic mode portrays historical reconstruction as an unfinished process, not simply because actual reconstruction is ongoing, but also because the interpretative reconstruction of history can never escape the narrative limits of representation. Comedy and tragedy are necessary forms for our understanding of the past, and the virtue of <i>Lola</i> is to recognize the necessity of these genres of historical representation, while refusing to declare either one to be the final word on the matter. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nI arrived in my hometown of Seattle with a few bags and boxes to begin life after college. After college: the words are innocuous, even fertile, but they also signal a departure from a certain world\u2014a world that envelops its inhabitants in creamy, inked pages that waft the stink of History when you fan through them, along with a network of friends whose close grouping softens the demands of inhabiting agency. It\u2019s a built community with an intentional focus that folds you into its structural logic. Here, I unpacked my belongings in the home of a family friend for whom I would house-sit for the next month. Faith that the world is round, that there is something beyond the horizon of one month, was my fuel.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBuilding a bridge into the future is the function of the architectural progress of our daily activities. We affirm today by constructing tomorrow. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLeaving college provides an uncanny view of the actual <i>building</i> that we do in our lives. Life up to when we move out of our parents' home is largely already constructed. As children we inhabit the <i>Lebenswelt</i> built by our parents and schools, the \u201clifeworld\u201d that, to a child, seems to have existed forever. It is the mold that we as vessels are shaped by. In college, more world possibilities suggest themselves, but the structure and progression of school still holds us in its form. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThings accelerate. There is a brick wall, an end of the line, and I saw it approaching in bursts, at times coming quickly and at times an unimaginable prophecy. Graduation.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nClasses end and I am swimming in thick sludge, arms glopping through erratically. Rhythmic breathing takes concentration. Rhythm\u2014up to now, life sauntered to a certain beat, a daily, weekly, and yearly recurrence of studying, writing, and discussing, with interludes for relaxation. There was a steady progression, a predictable growth, an effortless continuity that carried me from one year to the next. Graduation marked the end of that symphonic movement.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPerhaps it is complete faith and saturation in a single given world, rather than a contemplation of the slew of possible worlds one can choose to inhabit, that generates the creative playfulness of young children. This saturation is what we disoriented graduates must now attempt to reconstruct. The transition period immediately following college, no matter whether you are beginning a career, continuing in graduate school, or unemployed and aimless, suggests an endless possibility of \u201cdifferent lives\u201d in which one can choose to dwell. Deciding which direction requires a leap of faith. The sudden emergence from one way of living prompts us to find another way of living as quickly as possible. We would like this way of living to be the \u201cright\u201d one\u2014after all, it is finally our <i>own</i> decision, and if we get it \u201cwrong\u201d we will have to hold ourselves accountable. It is an anxious and lonely choice.\r\n <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n",

This may serve a variety of purposes, including criticism (for instance, a columnist assessing a work), analysis (a musicologist explaining an aspect of a work), exposition (describing a work to someone who has not heard it), or sympathetic remembrance (recalling a work with someone else who has heard it); in all of these situations, the way in which the speaker or author translates musical phenomena into words reveals important elements of how he understands the phenomena themselves. In Diderot's <i>Rameau's Nephew</i>, all four of these strains combine to give the reader a vivid, sometimes contradictory portrayal of the changes French musical perception was undergoing during the late 18th century.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThroughout history, modes of understanding musical phenomena, and thus of verbally representing and reconstructing them, have undergone significant changes; in his fascinating study <i>Listening in Paris</i>, James Johnson details a shift in French listeners' musical understanding from a Baroque/classical perception of music oriented towards outwardly focused, melodically-mediated signification to a Romantic/modern one oriented towards inwardly focused, harmonically-mediated sensation. Throughout much of the 18th century, discourse on music centered around and emphasized music as imitation, achieved primarily through melody, of extra-musical phenomena external to the subject, but as the century came to a close and Romanticism began to take hold, harmony superseded melody in perceived importance, and the terms of the discussion became less definite, more personal, and more ensconced in either specifically musical jargon on the one hand or approximate metaphor on the other. In 1761, the Manuel de l\u2019Homme du Monde could still confidently claim, \u201cAll music must have a signification and a meaning, the same as poetry; thus the sounds must conform to the things they express\u201d; but by 1796, Jean-Baptiste Leclerc, a French revolutionary instrumental in creating the Conservatoire de Musique, despaired of such unequivocal signification: \u201cAsk ten people the meaning of a Haydn symphony and you'll get ten different replies\u2014I've tried this experiment myself.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis understanding of the roles of melody and harmony was clearly a social construction: there is nothing inherent in melody implying that it should be heard as imitation, nor anything inherent in harmony suggesting that it should not be (and indeed, in different times and cultures both have been perceived differently). But for Parisian listeners of the late eighteenth century, the orientation toward melody as imitation was a powerful interpretive framework, supported through analogies with language and, somewhat more obliquely, with painting. Thus could Rousseau claim with many listeners of his time, \u201cAt first, there was no music but melody and no other melody than the varied sounds of speech... A tongue which has only articulations and words has only half its riches. True, it expresses ideas; but for the expression of feelings and images it still needs rhythm and sounds, which is to say melody\u2026.\u201d; and, \u201cThe role of melody in music is precisely that of drawing in a painting. This is what constitutes the strokes and figures, of which harmony and sounds are merely the colors. But, it is said, melody is merely a succession of sounds. No doubt. And drawing is only an arrangement of colors.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe music itself made use of a variety of techniques to achieve this imitative end. Numerous composers in numerous different works decorated the same key words\u2014words like \u201condes,\u201d \u201cvole,\u201d and \u201cenchaine\u201d (\u201cwaves,\u201d \u201cfly,\u201d and \u201cenchain\u201d)\u2014with vocal <a href = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melisma>melismata</a>; at other times, composers used orchestral effects to enhance the melody's imitative potential. The range of possible imitation was quite wide; it included natural phenomena such as storms and birdsong and expressions of human sentiment alike. It is tempting to see the imitation of human sentiment in modern terms, as the depiction of a unique and diffuse subjective state, but such an interpretation would be anachronistic: in their 18th-century musical manifestations, such feelings were turned outward and held to be repeatably representable, and thus substantially closer to the imitation of waves and birdsong than to the subjective evocation of psychological feeling with which the Romantic sensibility is familiar.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne can get a good idea of what constituted imitation for the 18th century listener from the following excerpts:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nExample 1:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/POydmjVrD0I\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n-The use of instrumental effects to imitate a storm made this a big hit with Parisian audiences; its spirit of imitation speaks for itself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nExample 2:\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/YkNaOB6lDQ4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n-Text: \u201cVole enchaine un peuple rebelle/Par les mains de la Volupt\u00e9/Partout o\u00f9 regne la beaut\u00e9/ L'amour triomphe avec elle.\u201d (\u201cFly, enchain a rebellious people/by the hands of pleasure/Everywhere that beauty reigns/Love will triumph with her.) The melisma on \u201cvole\u201d and \u201cenchaine\u201d\u2014both words which were frequently decorated thus\u2014suggest the actions of flight and enchainment, respectively. While such effects may seem strange to contemporary listeners, listeners of the 18th century were intimately familiar with them and interpreted them accordingly. More generally, the melody as a whole gives an admirable portrayal of voluptuousness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p>\r\nExample 3:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/U1xqO_ExixU\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\r\n<p>\r\nNote the declamatory style throughout, the degree to which the singing imitates speech. The correspondence of the declamatory melody to the feelings expressed is especially clear at such heightened moments as 2:22\u2014\u201cPers\u00e9e! Arr\u00e9tez, arr\u00e9tez!\u201d (\u201cPerseus! Stop, stop!\u201d )\u2014and 2:40\u2014\u201cPar l'exc\u00e8s de mes douleurs/Connoissez, s'il se peut, l'exc\u00e8s de ma tendresse\u201d (\u201cIn the excess of my sorrows, recognize, if you can, the excess of my tenderness\u201d ). Indeed, Lully's listeners would have recognized this sorrow and tenderness as much in the music they heard as in the acting they saw.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDuring the latter half of the 18th century, however, a nascent new paradigm was beginning to encroach on the familiar, imitative mode of listening; indeed, this threat may partially account for the abundant musical discourse defending the latter. It was centered on two phenomena: socially, the valorization of sensibilit\u00e9, which made its mark on musical life in the weeping and outright hysteria that audiences frequently exhibited at the Op\u00e9ra; and musically, a gradual shift towards greater harmonic complexity in the music performed. Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683-1764) was one of the earliest exponents of greater harmonic complexity in French opera. His works made use of increasingly sophisticated harmonic materials compared to those of his predecessors, and in his theoretical writing Rameau even went so far as to say that melody was in fact derived from harmony (in contrast to the dominant view of the primacy of melody) and that the latter could excite emotions in the sensitive listener. This was not initially well-received by the wider public, who accused his music of being recherch\u00e9 and overcomplicated; one critic summed up these charges in a rhyme:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nTo judge our modern music <br />\r\nI have a simple plan: <br />\r\nIf beauty is a theorem <br />\r\nRameau's a brilliant man. <br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut if by chance, pure nature <br />\r\nGuides beauty as its rule, <br />\r\nThen art must strive to paint it, <br />\r\nAnd Rameau's an utter fool. <br />\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat success Rameau's music did enjoy was primarily due to his continued use of imitative melody alongside the newly complex harmony (consider Example 2 above). However, other composers, such as Gluck, whose music awakened Parisian sensibility to an unparalleled degree, were appreciated as much for the pathos that listeners identified in their harmonies as for the imitative power of their melodies. It is hard to say exactly how this transformation took place; perhaps the best explanation is that harmony, at the time a hermeneutically empty vessel, was in a prime position to be filled with the sensibilit\u00e9 that Parisian audiences already felt in excess.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDiderot's unpublished satire <i>Rameau's Nephew</i> (c. 1761-1772), written at the twilight of the era in which music was perceived as imitation, speaks vividly to these changes in musical understanding and perception. It constructs a philosophical dialog between the narrator, known simply as \u201cMoi,\u201d and the nephew\u2014\u201cLui\u201d\u2014of Rameau. Rameau, we will recall, was at the forefront of harmonic innovation, a position which earned him no small measure of scorn and mistrust from both the musical public and philosophers and critics of the day. His harmonies, listeners claimed, were unnatural and overdone; his accompaniments were \u201cracked, flayed, and dislocated\u201d so as to be nearly unbearable. In the Querelle des Bouffons, a rivalry between 18th-century French and Italian opera composers, those who sided with the Italians often claimed that Italian music preserved music in its natural, melodically-oriented state and accused Rameau of having decisively ruined French opera with his unnatural harmonies.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis debate over Rameau's music ultimately led to a quarrel between Rameau and Rousseau. The issues at stake included no small measure of personal pride\u2014Rousseau, a would-be composer himself, felt slighted by Rameau's lack of appreciation for his efforts, and would later claim that Rameau had stolen and taken credit for his work\u2014but differences in musical belief played a prominent part as well. While Rameau maintained that harmony possessed an expressive importance equal to, if not greater than, that of melody, Rousseau, on the other hand, continued to uphold the primacy of imitative melody and took the side of the Italian composers in the Querelle des Bouffons. It is in this charged context that Diderot wrote <i>Rameau's Nephew</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><img src= \"/media/images/9/bibliophones.jpg\" width=530 class=\"picture\"><br><i>Sculpture and image by Zachary Nash</i></center></p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the dialog, Lui\u2014based partially but not entirely on Rameau's actual nephew, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rameau, who was also a composer and musician\u2014is presented as a slighted relation of the famed composer, living hand-to-mouth off rich men whom he flatters or cheats as necessary. Lui's contradictory character pervades the dialogue; as Moi describes him at the opening, \u201cHe is a mixture of loftiness and depravity, of good sense and buffoonery. The notions of honesty and dishonesty must be really badly confused in his head, for he shows without ostentation that nature has given him fine qualities, and has no shame in revealing that he has also received some bad ones.\u201d This character is able to reveal opinions and truths that, to Moi's mind, are repugnant or scandalous; Moi frequently censures them, yet at the same time recognizes them as compelling. The rational intellect embodied in Moi is confronted with the sensual appetite embodied in Lui\u2014and neither emerges decisively victorious.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMusic is a theme throughout the dialog, but its most lengthy exposition comes towards the end of the work, just after Lui has scandalized Moi with a tale of consummate and vicious hypocrisy. Wishing to change the subject, Moi turns back to music and asks Lui about the definition and basis of melody. The discussion begins rationally and conventionally enough; Lui responds:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cA melody is an imitation using the sounds of a scale invented by art or inspired by nature, whichever you like, either with the voice or with an instrument, an imitation of the physical sounds or accents of passion. You see that, by changing some things in this definition, it would fit exactly a definition of painting, oratory, sculpture, and poetry. Now, to get to your question. What's the musician's model or the model of a melody? It's declamation, if the model is alive and thinking; it's noise, if the model is inanimate. \u2026\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cWhen one hears <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHVtS8hVRc0>Je suis un pauvre diable</a>, one thinks one can recognize the sad cry of a miser. If he wasn't singing, he would speak to the earth in the same tones when he entrusts his gold to it, saying, O terre, re\u00e7ois mon tr\u00e9sor. And that little girl who feels her heart beating, who blushes, who's confused, and who begs the gentleman to let her go\u2014would she express herself any differently? In these works there are all sorts of characters, an infinite variety of declamations. That's sublime\u2014I'm the one telling you this. Go on, go on and listen to the piece where the young man who feels himself dying, cries out, Mon coeur s'en va. Listen to the song. Listen to the instrumental accompaniment, and then tell me what difference there is between the real actions of a man who's dying and the form of the melody.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nIn itself, this line of argument is hardly exceptional; it echoes what numerous theorists, philosophers, and listeners of the time were saying. Music is an imitative art little different from painting or other art forms; its medium may be different, but its ends are the same. In discussing the imitation of physical sounds, Lui references the numerous and often hugely popular musical depictions of such phenomena as storms, waves and birdsong. His claim that, for human passions, declamation is the model makes clear reference to Rousseau's application of his theory of language to music: in his <i>On the Origin of Language</i>, Rousseau asserts that language has its origin in expressions of passion, and that this origin is preserved in musical expression. The musical excerpts Lui cites to support his claims are all from operas by Duni<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup>\r\n, a well-received composer of the time whose music combined elements of French and Italian opera in music that was very declamatory indeed and that eschewed much of Rameau's harmonic complexity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut then, after the two men have discussed the relative merits of various contemporary musicians, the tenor of the conversation suddenly changes. Moi politely responds, \u201cThere's some reason in everything you've just said,\u201d a claim against which Lui reacts violently. He abjures reason and embarks on a chaotic performance of a medley of the music in question. The episode is worth quoting at length:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cHe began to get worked up and to sing very softly. As he grew even more impassioned, he raised his voice, and then there followed gestures, facial grimaces, and bodily contortions. I say, 'All right, there he is off his head, getting some new scene ready.' Then, in fact, he set off with a loud shout, 'Je suis un pauvre mis\u00e9rable... Monseigneur, Monseigneur, laissez-moi partir . . . O terre, re\u00e7ois mon or; conserve bien mon tr\u00e9sor . . . Mon \u00e2me, mon \u00e2me, ma vie, O terre! . . . Le voil\u00e0 le petit ami, le voil\u00e0 le petit ami! Aspettare e non venire...A Zerbina penserete...Sempre in contrasti con te si sta...' He crammed together and jumbled up together thirty songs\u2014Italian, French, tragic, comic\u2014in all sorts of different styles. Sometimes in a bass voice he went down all the way to hell, and sometimes he'd feign a falsetto and sing at the top of his voice, tearing into the high points of some songs, imitating the walk, deportment, gestures of the different singing characters, by turns furious, soft, imperious, sniggering. At one point, he's a young girl crying\u2014portraying all her mannerisms\u2014at another point he's a priest, he's a king, he's a tyrant\u2014he threatens, commands, loses his temper. He's a slave. He obeys. He calms down, he laments, he complains, he laughs\u2014never straying from the tone, rhythm, or sense of the words or the character of the song.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201c\u2026 As he was singing snatches from <a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKWeZqjbkvM>'Lamentations'</a> by Jommelli, he brought out the most beautiful parts of each piece with precision, truth, and an incredible warmth. That beautiful recitative in which the prophet describes the desolation of Jerusalem he bathed in a flood of tears which brought tears to everyone's eyes. Everything was there\u2014the delicacy of the song, the force of expression, the sorrow. He stressed those places where the composer had particularly demonstrated his great mastery. If he stopped the singing part, it was to take up the part of the instruments, which he left suddenly to return to the vocals, moving from one to the other in such a way as to maintain the connections and the overall unity, taking hold of our souls and keeping them suspended in the most unusual situation which I've ever experienced. Did I admire him? Oh yes, I admired him! Was I touched with pity? I was touched with pity. But a tinge of ridicule was mixed in with these feelings and spoiled them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201c\u2026What didn't I see him do? He cried, he laughed, he sighed, he looked tender or calm or angry\u2014a woman who was swooning in grief, an unhappy man left in total despair, a temple being built, birds calming down at sunset, waters either murmuring in a cool lonely place or descending in a torrent from the high mountains, a storm, a tempest, the cries of those who are going to die intermingled with the whistling winds, the bursts of thunder, the night, with its shadows\u2014silent and dark\u2014for sounds do depict even silence.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nTo appreciate the full force of this passage, one should first of all realize that Diderot's readers would have been intimately familiar with the music in question. They would have read Lui's polystylistic medley much as a contemporary reader might read an account in which someone sang, one after another, snatches of Katy Perry, The Beatles, and Radiohead, all the while acting out the music videos as well. It is a profoundly comical scene, but also one which viscerally evokes the various musical styles of the day. And it is a scene which, though patently ridiculous, is also at times admirable and even moving.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMuch of Lui's extraordinary acting out of musical experience echoes and reinforces the arguments regarding imitation that he had made in his previous, more reasoned state; but they are transposed from a register of criticism and analysis to one of experiential exposition. One notes that those passages whose imitative power Lui had previously praised\u2014\u201cJe suis un pauvre diable\u201d; \u201cO terre, re\u00e7ois mon tr\u00e9sor\u201d; the girl's plea that the gentleman let her go; and \u201cMon coeur s'en va\u201d\u2014are all included in his opening medley (along with several Italian arias from Pergolesi's \u201cLa serva padrona\u201d), although interestingly, while the titles of the first two had been mis-cited in Lui's analysis of melody, they are here more correctly recalled as \u201cJe suis un pauvre <i>mis\u00e9rable</i>\u201d and \u201cO terre, re\u00e7ois mon <i>or, conserve bien mon tr\u00e9sor</i>\u201d (emphases added), perhaps implying that Lui's impassioned performance is in some ways more true to the music in question than was his reasoned argument.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe breathless narrative conveys viscerally the nephew's succession of imitative incarnations, frequently identifying Lui with the people he is imitating. The 20th-century reader becomes caught up in it through sheer force of style, and one must imagine that for an 18th-century reader who was intimately familiar with the music involved, the effect was all the stronger. While Lui's imitation takes on extra-musical qualities such as gesture and deportment, the transformation itself is made through the medium of music, music which can by turns \u201ccry, laugh, and sigh.\u201d Now, instead of simply being told that the Duni arias perfectly embody the passions they are supposed to capture, the reader, impelled by Diderot's vivid descriptions, reconstructs the music mentally and feels those passions for himself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor all that this episode seems to support the arguments earlier advanced concerning the 18th-century way of listening, however, it also presents moments of contradiction. These are already suggested in the two Duni arias whose titles are misremembered in Lui's respectable, rational argument but correctly recalled in his somewhat ridiculous, passionate performance: if certain aspects of music are accessible only in the act of creating music and not in the act of discussing it, to what extent can such discussions really be trusted? And why did Lui get the titles wrong at first, but correct himself in singing? This question, at least, has a somewhat straightforward answer: the incorrectly recalled texts have two missing syllables (in the case of \u201cJe suis un pauvre diable\u201d/\u201cJe suis un pauvre mis\u00e9rable\u201d) or an extra syllable (in the case of \u201cO terre, re\u00e7ois mon tr\u00e9sor/O terre, re\u00e7ois mon or...\u201d), and this syllabic difference would cause problems in singing the melody. (It is worth noting that the remaining mistake \u2013 \u201cre\u00e7ois\u201d for \u201cvoici\u201d \u2013 does not interfere in this regard.) It is thus precisely the musical aspect of the texts in question that Lui's first argument gets wrong, and moreover in the very quality (declamation) which his previous argument had made out to be of utmost importance. The incorrect titles do not deviate substantially in meaning from the correct ones, but they do not fit the music.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe tension of Lui's performance with his earlier argument becomes all the greater when he turns to singing Jommelli's \u201cLamentations,\u201d wringing tears from his listeners. Given the attitudes regarding melody and harmony expressed previously, this choice of repertoire is an unexpected one indeed. Quite unlike Duni's music, Jommelli's is replete with the very qualities that audiences found objectionable in Rameau: complex, chromatic harmony and dense instrumental accompaniment. And yet, it is this very music which most enraptures the crowd. Also, Lui's performance is now described in overtly expressive terms (\u201cbathed in a flood of tears\u2026the force of expression, the sorrow\u201d) rather than imitative terms (\u201ca young girl crying\u2014portraying all her mannerisms\u201d); this, moreover, brings the listeners themselves to tears. Diderot describes the experience as very much internal to the individual listeners' \u201csouls\u201d\u2014in contrast to the doctrine of outwardly oriented imitation\u2014and markedly atypical (\u201cthe most unusual situation that I've ever experienced\u201d).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe reaction to this unusual situation, of course, is far from unequivocal; the listener's tears are bracketed by ridiculing laughter. Moreover, in saying that the ridicule \u201cspoiled\u201d his more indulgent feelings, Moi uses the verb \u201cd\u00e9naturait,\u201d a highly charged word in a time when \u201cunnatural\u201d was one of the worst charges one could levy against music (and a charge, moreover, frequently brought against harmonically complex music). Nevertheless, tears, pity, and admiration exist alongside ridicule and mistrust at what seems \u201cunnatural,\u201d and in this one sees the conflicted begins of a new form of musical experience, a form perhaps too new, and moreover too internal to the subject, to be expressed in rational argument, but one which nevertheless comes out in the acts of performance and listening themselves.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFollowing this extraordinary outburst, Lui seems to return to imitation; the remainder of his performance catalogues a truly impressive variety of natural sounds and human passion that gives a vivid picture of the whole gamut of phenomena, natural and sentimental, that 18th-century listeners believed could be imitated. However, even here imitation is not unproblematic; the final phenomenon imitated is silence itself. Diderot's claim that \u201csounds do depict even silence,\u201d at best, stretches the concept of imitation to its very limits. If, as Lui previously claimed, music is more or less analogous to painting, then claiming that sounds can depict silence is akin to saying that color can depict the invisible. Doing either requires a degree of abstraction, of seeing sounds used in music or colors used in painting as something more than simply sounds and colors, that falls somewhat outside of the bounds of musical sound as imitative of those sounds that humans and nature produce. However far-fetched it might seem to us to think of music imitating \u201ca temple being built\u201d or \u201can unhappy man left in total despair,\u201d both of these at least phenomena at least make some sort of noise the sound of a chisel against stone, the sound of sighs or groans\u2014whereas in the case of silence, sound is antithetical to the very phenomenon it is supposed to represent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn considering Lui's two somewhat contradictory presentations of musical phenomena, it is useful to note once more the very different registers in which each is made. Lui's initial argument is made primarily in analytical (when discussing the meaning and basis of melody) and critical (when discussing the merits of various composers and schools) modes. It begins from a standpoint of Enlightenment rationality with an assumed common experience of the music and makes its arguments on this basis. In his subsequent performance, on the other hand, Lui no longer assumes this experiential foundation and instead seeks to reconstruct the experience of listening itself in a way that is chaotic, often irrational, yet ultimately quite compelling. In doing so, he shows the constantly changing social practice of listening to be rather more complex than he might previously have assumed. Melodic imitation, it is true, is crucial to the manic appeal of the performance; but, bleeding outside these lines, expression of sentiment through harmony and the problem of \u201cimitating\u201d that which might seem inimitable are undeniably present as well, and point the way to a different mode of listening that was beginning to emerge at the time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere is perhaps no more poignant indication of the gulf between the two parts of Lui's discourse, and the change in musical understanding that gulf represents, than the way Lui closes each. After discussing the nature and construction of melody, Lui asserts, \u201cAnd you should believe everything I've said about this, because it's the truth\u201d; but after his performance: \u201cWell then, gentlemen, what's going on? Why are you laughing? What's so surprising? What's happening? Now that's what people should call music and a musician.\u201d In the first case, Lui appeals to external truth, perceived and judged by means of reason. In the second, however, himself discombobulated and unsure of what's happening, he can merely point to the listeners' shared experience of his performance as a model for what music should be: passionate and expressive of things which, at times, exceed the given boundaries of imitation. In this, he embodies the state of many Parisian listeners towards the end of the 18th century: caught between what they thought music must be and what they felt it was becoming. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\n\r\nThe first aria is completely faithful to Duni's text.

It's important to think about money as little as possible. Many people would disagree with me, but I think you will come to the same conclusion if you give it some thought.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nd. Marital status. You are married. You married Rick Madden in 2007. You loved him very much\u2013obviously. I assume you will divorce him immediately, since you've never met him. Do it quickly, don't hesitate. It\u2019s important that you do not live out the rest of your life just trying to recover the past (i.e. you have to make your own life). Maybe you already understand how important that is. Maybe not. When I explain that something is \"important\" I am trying to give you a sense of my values. But you shouldn\u2019t take anything I say on authority; rather, you should reflect on these values until they themselves convince you. Or if they don\u2019t, you should ignore them. That\u2019s very important. Anyway, I think you will agree in this case, because it's completely possible to divorce Rick without entirely cutting him off. I assume you will direct a significant portion of your inquisitive energies toward him, knowing he was your husband. You may as well get to know him. I would be curious to learn how the two of you would interact.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src= \"/media/images/9/tom1.jpg\" class=\"picture\" width=530><br><i>Illustration by Tom Tian</i></center></p> \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h6>4. A Brief Digression Regarding What to Expect from Your Ex-Husband</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI should warn you that it will be impossible to find out what your marriage was like from Rick: in the very act of trying to find out you will puncture it unknowingly. That's fine, of course\u2014you will have a new dynamic. He may enjoy your attention and your ignorance; possibly he will like you better than he likes me. In fact I suspect he will want to get back together with you. Beware of letting something you don't remember corrupt your judgment.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI write this in the attempt to temper the effect this word \u201cmarriage\u201d must have upon you. I am convinced you will overestimate the desirability of unlocking its secret; I would like to make you understand that it was neither idyllic nor tragic. In chapter three of this document I describe your history with Rick more fully. If nothing else, this description aims to disabuse you of the notion that the story of you and Rick was even much of a story at all.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo say it another way, while if you really wanted you could make Rick an important part of your future, he won't be able to help you find your past. I believe there's only one person who can help you with this, other than myself.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>5. Why It Won't Help to Talk to Anyone but Eliot</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nKnowing who to talk to is essential. First, you have to know who to trust\u2014and I have included a comprehensive list of all the people closest to you at the end of chapter five, so that if anyone not on that list tries to convince you that the two of you were once very good friends, or hopelessly in love or whatever, you will know not to believe them. But on top of that, few people can be good translators of experience. Even I may not be that helpful. I am trying my best to bring clarity rather than add confusion or entice you to seek out ever more secrets in all the wrong places. But I'm sure I am misleading you in some ways, and so it pains me to imagine how much more damage other people's stories could do.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMost of your friends and acquaintances (excepting the one) are not used to talking about you directly. Under the circumstances, they will begin to say things you've never thought about before. It\u2019s important not to take anything too much to heart. If they tell you, \u201cYou\u2019ve always been weird,\u201d don't think that previously you could grasp your own weirdness; don't think you became inaccessible to yourself only now. All people ask themselves what they are like, what people see in them, what the point of all this is, whether they're missing something important, and so on and so forth. So in ten years when you still have unanswerable questions, don\u2019t blame it on your amnesia.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>6. Why It's Immensely Important to Talk to Eliot</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAs I mentioned, there is one person who may be able to help you. Eliot knows you uncannily well and he is sufficiently patient, and intelligent, and articulate, and just with his emphases, and his mind is sufficiently similar to yours, that I think he will be able to give you a sense\u2014if only a teensy sense\u2014of how things were for you.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHe might think the project basically futile, though, and not try very hard, so you have to ask pointed questions. He will be depressed to have lost your friendship, he will close up because of it, so you have to spark his interest in this project of telling you things. To do this you have to seem very interested and detached and fresh. Be a new friend to him. Tell him your thoughts and feelings without hiding anything, but in a detached way, so that you become an object of shared curiosity. That's the only way to win him. It's okay if you tell him I said that.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDo everything you can to win him; it's worth your highest effort. Don't you agree that it sounds like a rare and desirable thing, a friend who has the ability to present you with your own past? And I don't mean just for the sake of your past. Hopefully you can see it already: something is truly mysterious here; something is worth seeking. Talk to him about it. Wonder about it. Make Eliot your new most pressing question.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h6>7. How to Be Careful When You Talk to Eliot</h6>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you want to win Eliot\u2014and I'm sure you do\u2014be careful. Certain mistakes could alienate him from you. First, keep in mind that unconditional friendship does not exist. If you are like me then it is deeply ingrained in you to think that once you and a friend are friends, nothing more could be needed. That all you have to do from then on is be in each other's presence and soak each other up and revel in the shared knowledge that you are friends. If you expect this, other people will break your heart. They demand fun, conversation, and near-constant newness in order to stay interested. And they\u2019re right. To be worthwhile, a friendship needs content.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSecond, under no circumstances should you fall in love with Eliot. Not only because he is <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality>homosexual</a> but also because he will disrespect you for falling victim to your romantic sensibilities. (This is presuming you have romantic sensibilities, which, for all I know, you've forgotten along with the plots of Hollywood movies.) Your friendship cannot rest upon contingencies; it must rest upon the most serious of abstract awakenings. Your common passion is impersonal. It is both of you before a great sky, showing each other the sky. Perhaps the best way to describe it is with an allegory. An allegory has a greater chance of making you understand than any jumbled account of remembered facts could.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>8. The Allegory Of The Boy On The Island (A Meditation)</h6>\r\n<p>\r\nImagine you\u2019re a young girl living a life very much like everyone else\u2019s. You live on the main continent which is where everyone lives. You have school and other things. There are minor conundrums. There are certain things you try to do. You choose what clothes to wear every morning. Your life is not totally without choice. Still, the whole of it gives off a particular hue: a very hazy muddled graying pink.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nJust one thing differentiates you from everyone else. Every Saturday (beginning some Saturday or other) you paddle your canoe to an island out at sea.  A person lives alone on this island. He is a boy. He is like you, young but not a child. He knows about the main continent but not very much about it. He has been there a few times. He found it not particularly worthwhile; he did not much like the people there. When you recount your experiences there he feels confirmed in his dislike. You tell him your minor conundrums. You teach him words: polite, normal, awkward. \"Isn't there an easy way out?\" the boy asks, incredulous. \"Why not simply explain...\" \"But they would find such an explanation strange,\" you say; \"they would think I had some hidden motive...\" When he hears your elaborate defenses for the mainlanders the boy laughs: \"But that\u2019s ridiculous!\" Over time he convincingly denounces every sentiment and habit of mainland culture. Their customs are arbitrary, their lifestyles unconsidered; muddiness is accepted as given. No leader seizes the opportunity to set an example in a meaningful, rational way. Indeed, every time you talk about the mainland the boy assures you that in an even marginally more thoughtful culture you would have an easier, more fulfilling, less hazy time. His views might strike you as extreme if they were not accompanied by remarkable acuity. In no time he gleans from you everything he needs to know to analyze the mainlanders' attitudes; on some occasions he even gives you advice for dealing with them and predicts their reactions exactly. And every Saturday, for six or eight or even twelve hours, you and the boy walk around the island together exchanging stories and impressions, and meanwhile inventing a new culture, a new way of conversing, one with rules centered around real and good things only\u2014beauty, pleasure, effort, progress, enrichment, honesty, and feedback. You invent and at the same time you enact this new culture. Meanwhile he lauds you for your thoughtfulness and thanks his atheist heavens that you and he, possibly the only thoughtful people in existence right now, have been united and can build this conversation together, once a week. He misunderstands you in ways that shame you into improvement. People on the mainland have friendships that center not on building something but on extracting bland approval and sleepy comfort from each other, on rubbing one another for warmth. Sometimes you protest that you yourself are no different from these people. After all, you are always complaining about your life to the boy, and he is always assuring you that you are in the right and everyone else is in the wrong\u2014is that not a warm comfort? But he assures you that it is not just for the sake of assurance that you complain; you complain because you really want to learn about what it is to be right, you really want to generalize to a vision of right and wrong so that you can build something. Mere comfort would not be satisfying to you. You are higher and better than that, the boy says, and you believe him.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhen you return to the mainland the muddy pinkish gray color is so oppressive that you can hardly believe you barely noticed it before.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>9. Some Irrelevant Observations That You May Nonetheless Find Interesting</h6>\r\n<p>\r\nIt was never as easy for you as it was for Eliot to sift through muddle. You were not able to sweep it out of your marriage, for instance. It's harder to take Eliot's advice than he expects\u2014and I've never figured out what makes it so hard. In some alternate reality things are different with Rick, but in this one what's left for me is to envision that alternate reality, to lie awake while Rick is asleep and stare at those foregone possibilities. And I truly think, or maybe I am just lying to myself, but I almost think, that this is a worthwhile way to live, to gaze perpetually at some unfulfilled possibility, if only it is a sufficiently beautiful unfulfilled possibility.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhy do I suggest you divorce your husband but pursue a renewal of friendship with Eliot to the greatest possible extent? I think I can explain. It seems to me that in life there are certain contingencies which happen to occur, things which are not absolutely necessary but which nonetheless form the course of our lives. And perhaps these contingencies are to be given their due respect and the commitments in which they entangle us are to be honored. But certain other things, though begun by and made up of contingencies, escape the realm of contingency and become eternal, and show us what we needed to be all along, the highest fulfilment of our being. Now that you have lost your memory you can no longer be bound by the old commitments\u2014you will come to be entangled in new ones and it's important that you honor those. But certain things you are sure to find all over again. I only want to help you find them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI can picture Eliot saying, \"The scariest thing would be to learn that, starting over and in another life, we would not become thoughtful\u2014\" (\"thoughtful\" is just our word that means building an island culture, it's like a shorthand) \"\u2014because having discovered this, that it's even <i>possible</i> for us not to be thoughtful, we would have to abandon everything.\" You didn't understand him then. You disagreed; you said it was only all too clear to you that in another life you might never have woken up, you might have wandered through without ambition, continually lying to yourself and feeling mildly content. And how could you be afraid to learn something you already knew well? But now I see a little bit what he meant. I think he went too far by saying that any single instance of possible thoughtlessness would dismantle the whole enterprise\u2014there can always be ignorance and neglect\u2014but I do think that if you listen to what I tell you, if you have the <i>opportunity</i> to wake up, then in that case you absolutely <i>have to</i> wake up, it's unthinkable that you wouldn't, or else all of my beliefs are as contingent as anyone\u2019s. I imagine you reading this and I imagine how you will live your life afterward, and I find myself deeply invested, as a point of honor. I flatter myself that my words will go straight to your heart, that you will admire them and see yourself in them.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>10. Conclusion of Chapter One and Explanation of What's Coming</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI hope the size of this file excites and does not intimidate you. Chapters two through five continue to provide a skeletal narrative of your past, detailing your experiences with family and friends. Chapter six outlines three separate reading plans which require varying amounts of commitment. Chapters seven and eight express certain ideas which I doubt can be learned from books alone. I hope these will all be helpful to you.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut before you go on I would like to express one thing. I know that I am just enacting my own fantasy of amnesia. After all, I wrote this without having any reason to believe I would come to lose my memory. I understand that if you do exist, you must have many difficulties that are unknown to me. It must be very hard and complicated and I cannot anticipate how. Therefore, I apologize for all the ways in which this document misunderstands you. I am sure they are many. All I can really say in the fullest epistemological humility is that I love you and wish you luck. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n",

Once the novelty of Soviet ruins fades and you come to see the city as a home (of sorts), you still can\u2019t help but feel that the place can never be yours. Even lifelong inhabitants and the governing class appear to take no real responsibility for the city; everyone seems to be squatting rather than owning. There is a palpable distance between the built environment of the city and its people. When one asks why the government doesn\u2019t remove the behemoth Soviet monuments and distinctive Soviet architecture that punctuate the city, the most common answer is something along the lines of: \u201cWe didn\u2019t put them there, why should we take them down?\u201d The haggard \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438 (old women) who peddle nuts on the street feel themselves to be a part of a nation that no longer exists, while the New Russian consumers identify themselves with a nation that cannot take responsibility for its materiality, for its landscape. Nobody is really living in the present; some are living in the past and some are living in a false idea of the present, a present without a past.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPerestroika, Russian for \u2018reconstruction,\u2019 generally refers to the period towards the end of the Soviet Union during which Gorbachev sought to restructure the Soviet system, making it more conducive to international and domestic trade. Despite the fact that these programs stood in opposition to the prior economic policies and stated ideology of the Soviet Union, the styles of propaganda produced to promote Perestroika were similar to those used in the past. As a 1988 stamp, designed to evoke the style of 1920\u2019s Soviet constructivist graphic artist Alexander Rodchenko, defines it, \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430: \u042d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0441, that is, \u201cReconstruction: the backbone of the living creativity of the masses.\u201d This slogan could just as well support one of Stalin\u2019s 5-year plans, Lenin\u2019s NEP or the 1917 revolution itself, while the graphic style of the illustration could easily blend into a collection of Leninist propaganda.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><img src= \"/media/images/9/emily1.jpg\" width = 530 class=\"picture\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis reference to past ideology through graphic style, this repurposing of a visual form which had been used to support very different ideas for decades, provides continuity with the past, although the policy (segue into capitalism) and consequences (catalyzing the fall of the USSR) of perestroika stand in sharp opposition to the previous ideology of the Soviet Union. Here the old Soviet system lives on, if only aesthetically, in the graphic and rhetorical design. Glavlit, the Soviet entity that controlled the press, tried to maintain such consistency right to the bitter end, even in the face of its own new policies, which stood in profound contradiction with its previous commitment to Soviet communism.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPerestroika saw the final phase of Soviet propaganda, which had been produced in a constant stream ever since the Russian Revolution. This material stood not only for communism, but also for the specific Soviet system of the time. It drew its significance from the relevance of Soviet communism to the every day lives of the people. The stream was self-perpetuating; prior propaganda produced a generation of loyal devotees, laying the groundwork for later propaganda. The effect of propaganda was very real: it produced feelings of nationalism, pride, and security among many Soviet citizens. In the Soviet Union, the government was the source for people\u2019s housing, food, employment and general well-being. Propaganda served to produce a sense of confidence in the government, which was necessary for the continuation of the system. One of the most effective features of Soviet propaganda was that it was instantly recognizable and comprehensible. One did not have to be literate to draw pride from an image of two confident-looking farmers with impeccable posture painted in bold colors. The union of art and architecture created an aesthetic continuity; everything was recognizably Soviet.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut why are these aesthetics so important? We have been conditioned to take the rhetorical and graphic style exemplified here as a cue to the social and political significance of the stamp. There is nothing inherent in the bold shadowing and steadfast expression of the figure that implies a particular political position; we know this style to be politically significant because we have been trained to understand it as such. As a result, it is impossible to employ this style without a nod to the period and politics with which it was originally associated. A particular history and culture have established this style as an indication of hard-line Soviet policy. While this stamp does not in fact stand for such policy, its use of these aesthetics establishes a false sense of continuity with the past. Yet the aesthetics and rhetoric that denote Soviet policy are arbitrary; they are simply components of recognizable signs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFerdinand de Saussure discusses this arbitrary association in his <i>Course in General Linguistics</i>. He distinguishes two aspects of the sign: the signifier, a sound or image which has been assigned a particular meaning, and the signified, the concept to which the signifier refers. Take, for example, a 200-ton statue of Karl Marx. Our perception of the statue in the form of a mental image is the signifier, while the concept that it stands for, proletarian revolution, is the signified. In this case, the concept, the signified, is unequivocally political, just as Rodchenko\u2019s style of graphic design is irrevocably linked to the political motivations implied in it. A monument to Marx necessarily signifies much more than the representation of a specific person, because Marx himself is a sign. Considered as a sign, Marx\u2019s signifier is our perception of him, and his signified is the individual, Karl Marx. The individual Marx\u2019s signifier is an image of him, or his written name, while the signified is his ideology and its result, communism. Not theoretical communism, but the foundation of the livelihoods of 200 million people for 80 years: communism as an ideological opposition to the greedy capitalism of the West, as the pride of the fatherland and the belief that those who had perished in World War II had not died in vain.<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup> The signified entity was the relevance of communism to the lives of the people.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe approach concepts in the ways that we have been conditioned to approach them, depending on the ways in which we have been taught to understand signs. In order for a language, for example, to be functional, Saussure argues, there must be a social consensus on the signifier/signified relationship. We must agree that the written word \u2018tree\u2019 refers to our perception of a tree (a large carbon-based plant) in order for the word to be of any use. Lenin, in 1920, conceived a statue to be built of Karl Marx on Teatralnaya Square in Moscow because there was a social consensus as to the signified, Marx = communism. Moreover, the statue is laden with socially accepted signs in addition to the likeness of Marx, such as his erect posture, his confident expression and the phrase, \u201cworkers of the world, unite!\u201d The style of rendering, too, is distinctive; it signifies a Soviet political message, much like Rodchenko\u2019s style of graphic design.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><center><img src= \"/media/images/9/tom2.jpg\" width=530 class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Tom Tian</i></center></p>\r\n<p>\r\nMany of the signs that refer to Soviet structure and ideology had been deliberately created; the social consensus as to the signifier/ signified relationship had been forced. Constant deliberate exposure to recognizable aesthetics and styles of rhetoric systematically enforced by organizations such as Glavlit created a clear system of signs that were easily readable. Perestroika attempted to maintain this semiotic consistency while propagating counter-Soviet policy. The post-perestroika era yielded further \u201creconstruction\u201d and an official distance from the propaganda of past. The constant stream of propaganda which had once created a consensus as to the meaning of signs suddenly ceased. The signifiers themselves, however, the ubiquitous images of signs past, manifest through statuary, architecture, art and literature, remain in place. The significance of these signs lay in the constant affirmation of the value and relevance of Soviet communism in the lives of the people. Once this affirmation ceased, moreover, once the value and relevance of Soviet communism was officially denounced, the significance was lost. What becomes of these signifiers once what they once signified has been removed? Once the relevance of communism had faded, what became of what stood for its importance?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the physical sense, perestroika was not reconstruction at all, but re-labeling, a social reconditioning. The physical landscape of the old country, the infrastructure, statuary, architecture, decadence and organization remain, but the official attitudes toward them have changed. The statues of Marx are no longer officially meant to glorify his image, but are to officially signify nothing. The KGB is to be renamed the FSB, but is to be comprised of all of the same people and located in the same building in Lubyanka Square. The Kremlin is to maintain its name and function, but is to be the residence of the President and Prime Minister rather than of the General Secretary of the Communist Party, or of the Czar, as it once had been. The referents are the same; history existed, but the ways that it is socially appropriate to understand the signs have changed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn Saussure\u2019s system, a monument is both a signifier and a signified; it is both a referent in and of itself, and a signifier meant to belie something else conceptually. But what happens to the signifier once the signified, the relevance of the Soviet system, is taken away? That is, what becomes of the sign once the signified is nullified? As S.I. Hayakawa discussed in his 1949 piece on semiotics, <i>Language in Thought and Action</i>, \u201cThe first of the principles governing symbols is this: The symbol is not the thing symbolized; the word is not the thing; the map is not the territory it stands for.\u201d If the word is not the thing, is the thing the thing? If a monument to Marx was originally meant signify the glory of his legacy and the relevancy of his work, what does it mean once his legacy has been defamed by the same authority that once erected the statue?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat has resulted is confusion and disconnect between the signifier and the signified, making the signs unreadable. Rather than subscribe to the new system of signs regarding the old regime, many people would rather not read a sign at all. I was once walking with a Muscovite friend, a New Russian student at the State Economic Institute, a classmate of President Medvedev\u2019s son. I pointed to the aforementioned 200-ton statue of Marx, in Teatralnaya Square, facing the Bolshoi Theatre in the central part of Moscow. I asked of whom this monument was, unable to read the text from a distance. She replied, \u201cSomething communist, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t like communism.\u201d Born in 1992, she never experienced communism herself, and despite being surrounded by physical remains of the system, she has opted out of an understanding of the past in order to look forward.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI am not asserting that all citizens of states of the former Soviet Union live in ignorance of their countries\u2019 past, though my sense was that the overstimulation of political symbolism of the USSR has left a vocal portion of the population desensitized and apathetic to what the surrounds them once stood for. Signs have been reconstructed, that is, redefined until they have been rendered meaningless.\r\n\r\n<p><center><img src= \"/media/images/9/emily2.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>\u041f\u0420\u041e\u041b\u0415\u0422\u0410\u0420\u0418\u0418 \u0412\u0421\u0415\u0425 \u0421\u0422\u0420\u0410\u041d, \u0421\u041e\u0415\u0414\u0418\u041d\u042f\u0418\u0422\u0415\u0421\u042c!

            "rendered_content": "<p>There are currently two occupations in Washington, DC.  One had been planned months before Occupy Wall Street: a week of action against the American Wars, called \u201cStop the Machine.\" It was to re-energize the mostly dormant anti-war movement, using camping as a method of sustained action and coalition building.  The other was a response to the call following Occupy Wall Street and calls itself \u201cOccupy DC.\"  It\u2019s strange.  The \u201cStop the Machine\u201d protestors are self-identified leftists, anti-war activists, non-profits and socialist parties working in coalition. The Occupy DC protest, in contrast, is full of folks new to organizing.  Apparently most of them didn\u2019t even know the planned protest was going on.</p>\r\n<p>What happens every day in DC now is a strange dance between the two camps. The Occupy DC marches draw tactics from the extant left, but feel themselves to be using them in new and fresh ways. The \u201cStop the Machine\u201d protestors are still using those tactics, but their whole frame has changed since Occupy Wall Street broke out. They only intended to camp out for a week and then get arrested, and now the parks department extended their permit to four months. Now they use very similar General Assembly procedures to Occupy DC and they\u2019ve lost their anti-war focus. The camps are on friendly terms, but it\u2019s awkward.  No one quite knows why there are two camps, but no one seems too excited about unifying.  </p>\r\n<p>My first instinct, which I think is common, is to take this awkwardness as an obstacle, a hump that we must devote our time to getting over.  But looking at at least 30 years of impasse on the left I\u2019m skeptical of this instinct.  Instead maybe we should be exploring our surroundings, letting ourselves drift a little in the present.  At the moment it seems impossible to conceptualize a reconstitution of the left, it\u2019s difficult to even say the words \u201cthe left\u201d and not feel anachronistic and nostalgic.  But the homelessness of the left and our political depression doesn\u2019t need to stop us.  Instead of being one more instance of the left not \u201cgetting it,\" this awkwardness might help us in our efforts to figure out where we\u2019re going.</p>\r\n<p>It might seem strange to use the term \u201cthe left\u201d so cavalierly.  But I\u2019m writing this for a simple reason: I want to be a leftist.</p>\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n<p>Naomi Klein began her speech at Liberty Plaza in New York City by saying, \u201cI love you.\" Slavoj \u017di\u017eek began in his address to the crowd with a word of caution about romance. Apt, if love is the refuge of the desire for true intersubjectivity into an exterior object. The feeling, pervasive on the left, is of fresh love, when your crush begins to return your glance or laughs at jokes that aren\u2019t quite funny.  It\u2019s less a prolonged, committed intimacy as much as it is an expression of sheer glee for having an object in the first place.  </p>\r\n<p>But becoming intimately in love with your object is also becoming close to shattering loss.  You never know when some reality (it could be as quiet as discovering that being bored with the person is in fact boring) will pull the floor out from under you, shattering all your attempts at world building.  </p>\r\n<p>Many on the left recognize so strongly in the Occupy movement an image of their fantasy to be <i>on the inside again</i>, to be one side of the barricades. But they are cautious.  The image feels thin, billboard-like, not because it is emptied out by commodification, but because it\u2019s beauty is never so striking as when caught in the bright light of corporate media, circulating with the spectacles of advertising like they\u2019ve pulled one over on hegemony and finally made politics public again.   In the circulation of immediate, everyday life however the movement is tiring, and trying and worrisome.  At a protest on the Strip in Las Vegas, a man dressed as Elvis picked up a sign and began posing dramatically for the camera.  This was my dream, a man on the street, one in fact \u201con the job\u201d since he was there to make tips, spontaneously joining the protest. But he was posing as much out of clowning as out of solidarity.  When asked what his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d sign meant he would probably not be able to say. If you asked him to come to meeting he\u2019d likely say no, or maybe he\u2019d say yes but never show.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/media/images/10/tom-elvis.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Tom Tian</i></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This isn\u2019t new for an experienced organizer. So often we\u2019re lied to by folks who say they want to struggle but end up being unreliable.  It\u2019s the source of a timidity around new movements or campaigns. You learn to deal with the unreliability of those you\u2019re organizing as an organizer. You become calloused. You stop taking people at their word; you learn to call enough times for them to get annoyed, to show up at their house to drive them to the action if necessary.  Our love affair with the proletariat is over; and now each new beloved revives the same doubts about reliability and durability.  I don\u2019t want to love the Occupy movement, and I don\u2019t want to call myself an \u201coccupier\u201d if as soon as a federal jobs program starts I\u2019m left in my tent alone.  There\u2019s plenty of love, but it\u2019s unsure and tender and sometimes it feels like I\u2019m taking it slow on purpose.</p>\r\n<p>The trepidation of the left isn\u2019t without basis in experience either.  Our optimistic attempts to join the movement have not always been successful or even welcome.  I\u2019ve been trying to be involved with Occupy Las Vegas as much as possible to provide experience, skills and at times leadership. The higher-ups at the union where I\u2019m employed look at me strangely when I tell them about sleeping in a tent or spending my evenings outdoors in a parking lot.  For a few nights I ended up with the role of facilitator of General Assemblies\u2014which is (in case you haven\u2019t had to try it) a very difficult task.  I have experience facilitating, and I\u2019ve worked in consensus-based environments before, so I figured it would be a way for me to support the group.  Over the course of two nights I presided over the decision making process for what actions the group would take on and in fact did what I responsibly could to have the group stage a protest at the target of an organizing campaign being undertaken by my union.  </p>\r\n<p>The night after the group decided to do the action I was sitting talking with my comrade who also works for the union, exhausted by the hour and half of facilitating, when a fellow occupier came up and said started asking about my connection with the union and whether I thought it was a problem that I\u2019d been facilitating.  It was odd to me at the time and I didn\u2019t understand his full meaning till the next night when the General Assembly exploded with accusations of the union attempting to co-opt the movement.  I was not there for most of the meeting, but when I was there people talked about the need to focus on Occupy\u2019s issue of \u201cthe banks\u201d and how groups needed to be involved as individuals \u201cnot as organizations.\u201d  After the GA I facilitated, it turned out, rumors circulated about my suspicious involvement in the union. Why was the group doing a protest on <i>the union\u2019s</i> issue? I took the whole situation irrationally hard, maybe because I was tired, maybe because I was shocked at how naive the group was being. And, partly too, I was shocked the group\u2019s disregard for all the decisions I\u2019d facilitated in the GA. But a big part was shame.</p>\r\n<p>I was ashamed that I hadn\u2019t been a good enough facilitator or leader.  A good organizer knows to predict people\u2019s hang-ups and inoculate folks.  In fact I hadn\u2019t been transparent enough about my affiliations, and I hadn\u2019t had the energy to keep engaged after the meetings I facilitated to make sure people felt good and the things decided were on track to get done.  The shame is about not measuring up to an impossible and insane image of myself.  I stayed involved after that, and plenty other frustrating and upsetting things have happened, but I\u2019ve been more careful about sticking my neck out.</p>\r\n<p>The shame encountered by leftists around the movement is about more than just failures.  Recently a  comrade of mine responded abruptly to the assertion that Occupy was a mass movement.  He said \u201cI feel like that shames me.\"  \u201cIf this were a mass movement,\u201d he reasoned, \u201cand I feel so ambivalent and even resentful toward it, then I am guilty of resenting the masses.\u201d  A revolutionary cannot resent the masses; it can be a tense relationship, but it must be one of love and caring.  He doesn\u2019t want to have to love this movement which feels so alien and improper to him; he doesn\u2019t want to have to bear the guilt of feeling like he does toward <i>the people</i>.</p>\r\n<p>What\u2019s so difficult about this emotion is that so often coming to the left is a path out of shame.    Shaming is so tied to the process of victimhood. Sexual assault victims are often gripped with self-guilt; neoliberal discourse incessantly blames the poor for their own plight; even mundane shaming by a manager is crucial to maintaining worker discipline.  The key to becoming strong is learning that this shame is false.  Shame is supposed to index the hegemonic false sovereignty of the market that is <i>replaced</i> by a truer sovereignty found in struggle.  A strong leader does not feel shame, they accuse; they shame those who maintain hegemony.  Nothing brings more glee than shouting \u201cShame!\" through a bullhorn at a customer crossing a picket line, or watching a crowd of hundreds chant \"Shame\" at police brutally detaining a peaceful protester.  As a privileged student (and a straight-white-male at that), learning to be in solidarity with oppressed peoples was a way to deal with the shame of living on the good end of inequality.  The hours spent in privilege workshops, taking care with my language and \u201cbeing a good ally,\" were coping mechanisms to make my (un)fortunate social position bearable. </p>\r\n<p>When I first became an activist I was motivated by the drive to be the perfect, insane image I had.  I take great pride in how successful I\u2019ve been getting past this and grounding my leftism in a more healthy and consistent way that finds my own roots of struggle instead of imagining myself coming from some free \u201coutside.\"  The fact that I reverted back to this destructive mentality when faced with a challenge at the occupy camp was itself a source of shame, and, as shame does, it set off a positive feedback loop of being ashamed for being ashamed for\u2026</p>\r\n<p>I feel I must suppress the shame for fear of getting caught in that positive feedback loop, for fear of what might sweep me away from the struggle.  But at a moment when so many are being introduced to the history of the left for the first time, shame may in fact be a powerful tool for building solidarity.  Understanding that it\u2019s a significant part of our relation to ourselves and to the world could help bridge gaps between the extant left and the newly political. Sharing stories of shame in an organizing scene may help folks feel more legitimized and less alone in their struggle.  Leftists writing creative and analytical reflections on shame may help to humanize and resist the tendency toward mythology that is so problematic for left leadership.  Indeed creative public actions around shame might even be possible like impromptu communal sharing of shame stories disruptively in a public space.  Being open to shame could mean accepting and remembering the difficulty in \u201cbecoming left.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Love and Shame are not necessarily the most prevalent affects on the left regarding the Occupy movement, but they do remind us of something more fundamental about the left in this moment.  The left is tender, timid, scared and full of trepidation and self-doubt, almost too sensitive to face the world.  The last 30 years have felt like one beating after another.  For those who became activists in this period it was only a matter of time before they faced a devastating failure.  Lives on the left have felt misshapen and tenuous, warped by coping mechanisms.  Those who want to keep their pride become cynical and resentful and scoff at the failure of any movement to develop a properly sophisticated analysis.  Those who want to keep their optimism scale back their expectations so that remaining human is itself the highest form of resistance.  Those who want to keep their grand vision develop the glazed over eyes and disjointed reason of a cult follower.  </p>\r\n<p>The recent explosion of mass mobilization and public left-sympathy has shaken the foundations of these coping mechanisms.  Finally an event shows the abstruseness of our ideologies, the smallness of our vision, and the infeasibility of our systems. It exposes how raw and sensitive we are. Our juvenile love and our shame are indices of this sensitivity. I want to dwell on them because I think this sensitivity is the foundation of the left\u2019s strength.  It\u2019s only because we listen to stories of struggle and oppression, and cannot stand for injustice, that we can organize at all. We became leftists because we could not be callous to an unfree world, because we could not bear the shame we felt or hide our love of people. I said I didn\u2019t want to see the left\u2019s awkwardness as a failure; that\u2019s because its rooted in the same place as our power to succeed. </p>\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n<p>Much of this might be obsolete by the time it\u2019s published.  The movement has already taken on decidedly more militant and political flares in many places and folks from the left have become much more central.  My newsfeed from my activist friends is filled with updates from around the country.  In the Oakland General Strike I saw the first images from my lifetime of the historical process I want to be a part of.  A banner across an intersection reading \u201cDeath to Capitalism,\" \u201cStrike\u201d in one-story-tall letters on a Whole Foods; tens of thousands marching, <i>not to show their numbers, but to shut something down</i>.  On a recent trip to the encampment in Portland, Oregon, I saw the circle-A everywhere. Everyone was talking politics; when I dropped off some fruit to the kitchen they thanked me \u201cfor feeding the revolution.\"  Much of my continued negativity has to do with persistent issues in Las Vegas, but even here things are getting more congenial to the left.  Some folks, some of who identify as anarchists and communists, have started talking about forming an organization that has more focused politics and tries to do strategic actions around specific issues.  I\u2019m starting to feel more at home in the movement.</p>\r\n<p>The left is the community of individuals, institutions, organizations, political parties and discourses that I call home.  I read <i>The New Left Review</i>, watch <i>Democracy Now!</i> every morning and can identify the full names and ideological affiliations of more than a dozen left-wing parties.  These aren\u2019t criteria for being left, they\u2019re my attempts at building a life of struggle for myself. So is the insistence in this essay of using the term \u201cthe left,\" even when it may seem imprecise and nostalgic.  My Left is the community that defines itself around the struggle against injustice, asserts its agency over the forces of oppression and takes up a common history that points backward toward servitude and forward toward freedom.  I want to be a leftist and I call myself one because I\u2019m proud of that community and history.   I want a politics that I can project into the future, that I can ask normative questions to and that I can call my own.</p>\r\n<p>We\u2019re not there yet. \u201cThe left\u201d is still in an impasse.  A revolutionary must be patient, but it\u2019s hard and awkward.  It\u2019s from out of this discomfort that a real left will emerge.  At this point all I have is faithful resignation; faith that the problems of the movement won\u2019t doom the project of human emancipation, resignation to what it reveals about how hard that project is.  With this resignation I return to the site of Occupy Las Vegas each night, help unload water deliveries, and write this essay.  As my comrade and tent-mate Mike Hachey often says as we lay on our floor of furniture pads protecting our hip bones from the hard asphalt, \u201cWelcome to the new normal.\u201d  <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/media/images/10/tom-commie.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Tom Tian</i></center>",

I wonder how people in so miserable a state do not fall into despair. I see other people around me of a similar nature: I ask them whether they are better informed than me; they tell me no. These miserable lost people, having looked around them and seen some pleasing objects, have given and attached themselves to them.

The occupation of Zucotti Park seemed like <i>an</i> instance of occupation. We wondered whether the senses of the word had enough unity. Occupation = labor did not seem to comprehend occupation = an activist tactic or occupation = military fact. But because preoccupation = anxiety = <i>souci de soi</i> is what gets in the way of work, what is given time on the commute or put off in leisure, even what prescribes work as ergotherapy or forbids it in favor of a talking cure made into a way of life we thought we could run \u201cOccupations\u201d if we just stayed in these limits. I didn't realize until I started talking to the writers that these \u201climits\u201d were exactly what I had in mind on October 2nd in a little note I scribbled in a cafeteria. There, I was thinking about some friends I'd made in Brussels, and the shock of, suddenly, around them, not feeling weird about my sexuality. It contradicted what I'd thought I'd learned about the futility of changes of context:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cIn 'ordinary time' people are going around working on their problems or projects usually within static limits. If I think of it this way, will that help? If I change this thing, will that help? In the ones who are traveling constantly it's like the stasis of these limits has become tidal. But then all the limits change all at once and the scheduled projects and chores for feeling better or understanding what's going on with you are suddenly irrelevant, impossible, or incomprehensible. Even the problem is impossible or incomprehensible. And for everyone at the same time. All at once, everyone is off. Not to think of history as a work or a project without also remembering the suspension of work, the negation, the blankness. I hope this is what they're having right now in America.\u201d</p>",

The pivot was something \u017di\u017eek said in the papers:</i>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        [...] I agree with much of what Zizek said in his address at Zuccotti Park, which included a dose of this realism. And though I'm sticking words in their\r\n        mouths, I'm with David Harvey too, I think, to name various others, in believing <i>the People's Paranoia\u2014</i>to coin a phrase\u2014of (political)\r\n        representation the biggest threat to the success of the revolutionary moment. This paranoia is doubtless the handicraft of liberalism, and I include\r\n        among its line ploys of philosophical sophistication, theoretical adroitness, polysemousness, and all sorts of gibberatics, widespread today, which\r\n        produce the hotheaded likeness of something thought deviously outside the worst record of an author entitled to some reader. They who are the authors\r\n        entitled to the labor of readers! Oh we can be so <i>blocked.</i>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        We must now basically engage in statecraft. But the statecraft demanded today is not, principally, a form <i>of authorship</i>. Can I say that? Much\r\n        has been made (in the name of statecraft) of the People's Mic\u2014registering its univocal aspect, the perforce identity of author and public. Such\r\n        discussion articulates fealty to sacrosanct ideals of participatory democracy and consensus; and some have bristled anxiously at its attendant fascist\r\n        auratic. These plaudits and tantrums, I think, are hands on the same dial; and each mistakes the schedule of pleasure determined by the People's Mic,\r\n        which inaugurates a community not of authorship but <i>of readership. </i>This is, at least, how I wish to read this microphone <i>as paradigm.</i>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Parceling oratory into stet bundles, arousing enjambed speech\u2014the new technology suspends authorial stasis and elicits the historical precession of\r\n        hallucinatory closures experienced by any reader absorbed in any text. Its medium is punctuation, and its habitat is the sound track. It has something\r\n        of the animate backspin of\r\n        <a\r\n            href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=QjA1iPqs8G8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=gunslinger%20ed%20dorn&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\"\r\n            target=\"_blank\"\r\n        >\r\n            Gunslinger\u2019s\r\n        </a>\r\ndraw. It loves the comic, flip, casual, digestive, absorptive, passionate, arch, sentimental, and tender. It wants to give body to speakerly        <i>affect, </i>to the exogenous stupid that afflicts a readers\u2019 lips. It announces the commons as an erotic potentiality necessarily external to the\r\n        strict economy of author and reader, producer and consumer, but decidedly, I think, on the side of the reader. This commons will never be written, and\r\n        you can only take pleasure in the pleasure of its readers.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        At the assembly, I enforce the new technology\u2014ruthlessly, even. Is it the Law? An orthodoxy? I don't think so, exactly. But when I shout verbatim\r\n        across the delinquent speaker, I listen with their own words for the fine caesura, and motivate my own aggression to the cited oblivion of the coming\r\n        text. How else will we survive the sheer <i>chronicity</i> of such a fine-grained political process? I enforce it with my life, which has become a\r\n        funny, smiley, annoyed thing that I do with my body. And when I leave the assembly, or the next day feel the unwelcome responsibility, verging itself\r\n        on obligation, to return impossibly again, and enforce my own words, I remember that there will be others there today\u2014readers!\u2014blogging the acts and\r\n        coughing up their mannered own, in the stunning viscosity of political organization. And this is something, I believe, to the credit of the division of\r\n        labor that will necessarily attend any post-capitalist reorganization. It is readers who give attitude to the enforced labor of others. Can an author\r\n        know anything but austerity?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Successfully speaking at the GA using the People's Mic is not a complicated subject. Basically, you make arguments for listeners, fine-grained,\r\n        situated, arguments, preferably\u2014that register the threat of conversation <i>with their breath.</i> When Jesse Jackson came to the Chicago GA on day, I\r\n        don't know, 7? He could barely use the People's Mic because I think he already speaks the form more fluently than any other human. Have you ever heard\r\n        such a heavily enjambed line? Look it up. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txbNNKzZd9w\" target=\"_blank\">\u201cIt's morning time,\u201d</a> pun intended.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Tons of people are bad at it, period, because it's difficult to tend to the rhythm of a thought as you're having it\u2014we learn. We learn it\u2019s a bodied\r\n        thing in which we all end up looking like rodents, or pedants, or serpents, or cheerleaders, or just something else. There\u2019s a reason why all the best\r\n        art about the occupations feels a bit mournful. The occupations are mournful. They have the capacious \u2018tude of mourning, the paratactic, monotonous,\r\n        rhapsodic, credenzaic ordinary flat line of the serial enumerate. This is my beef with people who wish to beat the secret out of the event. There is no\r\n        secret, no knowable trauma whose DNA, once uncovered, will guide us formulaically to some consequence and conclusion. Sure, this event has inducted us\r\n        into its confidence. But we will never know what happened anally. Though there is history.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        What we need to develop are autonomous, creative fixtures of social care. Of orality, as I'm thinking of it suddenly. Such fixtures are a necessary\r\n        corollary to any militant <i>action</i> directed against whatever is. I say this as someone who tries not to be afraid of sex, who tries to picture sex\r\n        instead as an episodic excuse for my own undoing. But art, for one, can promote careful absorption in the social, the plastic aspect of lasting in the\r\n        rhythm of mourning in the morning, of finding out what's not only there. We must, in this sense, be able to become <i>passive </i>to form, as Lauren\r\n        Berlant <a href=\"http://supervalentthought.com/2010/06/21/on-passivity-not-otherwise-specified/\">has said</a>. What else would it look like to demilitarize economic life? If I am anxious, then, <i>about something,</i> it is that I want to\r\n        become inefficient <i>for something</i>\u2014that I wish, somehow, to have made myself obvious. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n    </p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>\r\nListening to their releases, media quotes, drafts of demands, signs, and so on, you\u2019d get the impression that Occupy Wall Street\u2019s main concerns are the concentration of wealth in the hands of the top 1%, the outsize influence of money in the political process, our shrinking welfare state and lax regulatory regime, and the inherent oppressions of capitalism upon the 99%.\r\n</p>\r\n    <p>\r\nBut looking instead at their actions, and at the organizational structures they\u2019ve placed at the heart of their movement, it seems like the occupiers\u2019\r\nmain concern is with Voice. What they want is for <i>everyone</i> to be heard, for everyone to have the chance to speak, for no one\u2019s voice to be silenced or elided, for no one to speak for anyone else. Suppression of speech is a key term in American political discourse and a basic symbol of injustice for the whole political spectrum, but that section of the left that\u2019s set up camp in the country\u2019s downtowns takes free, unobstructed, heard speech as the sole origin-point of all rights and liberties.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        This overriding concern with allowing and promoting speech stems from the left\u2019s historical self-devouring. The proletarian universalism of industrial\r\n        labor unions and socialist parties was disrupted first by the civil rights and feminist struggles of the 1950s and \u201860s. These movements fractured in\r\n        turn. Feminists were attacked by womanists who claimed, not incorrectly, that feminism had been constructed around the concerns of white women alone.\r\n        As gays and lesbians started to make progress with their own struggle for civil rights, other sexual minorities clamored to be heard and respected.\r\n        Where once the left saw society divided into classes, as opposed to the unitary nation of the right, today it sees thousands or perhaps millions of\r\n        affinity groups, each of which must tread carefully to avoid speaking for its members.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        The modern leftist has spent their life watching liberationist movements fracture into affinity groups and movementlets that may form tenuous\r\n        coalitions but never abandon their hard-won right to speak for themselves within the left, or their ongoing struggle to exercise the same voice in the\r\n        mainstream. Against this background, how could it ever be okay for anybody to speak for anybody else?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        This explains the simultaneous appeal of \u201cdirect democracy\u201d and the rejection of voting. Direct democracy does away with what political theorist Jodi\r\n        Dean <a href=\"http://jdeanicite.typepad.com/i_cite/2010/11/inept-or-unwilling.html\">has called</a> \u201cthe crime of representation\u201d: without\r\n        representatives, no one has to delegate their voice to someone else. Voting, meanwhile, means the voice of the minority is ignored in favor of that of\r\n        the majority. The main advantage of consensus is that the outcome is determined by everyone\u2019s voice, not just those voices which can command enough\r\n        support. Consensus also encourages persuasion and discussion past the 51% mark, as opposed to the sometimes divisive majoritarianism of voting. These\r\n        are just about its only advantages; it is slower, more frustrating, and less efficient, and it has a conservative bias towards indecision and inaction.\r\n        But if Voice is the point of the process, the sacrifices are more than worthwhile.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        In addition to consensus decision-making, the General Assemblies at the heart of the occupations employ other techniques optimized for Voice. The main\r\n        one, which has become the symbol of the current occupations although it did not originate there, is the people\u2019s microphone. As facilitators always\r\n        explain to newcomers, the way the people\u2019s mic works is that everyone within hearing range repeats the speaker\u2019s words, whether they agree with them or\r\n        not. It is by common consent that speakers reach an audience, but this consent is compulsory; if you shout \u201cMic check!\u201d a few times at an occupation,\r\n        whatever you say next <i>will</i> be heard. Delivering or listening to a speech via the people\u2019s mic is slow and frustrating, and the medium always\r\n        colors the message. There\u2019s an effective ceiling on how long and complex clauses can be, but sentences wind on and on as relative pronouns and\r\n        conjunctions pile up. After all, if you end a sentence you may lose the floor. The occupations don\u2019t use clapping to express support, because it makes\r\n        such a racket that people can\u2019t be heard. Instead they use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_hand_signals\">a set of hand signals</a> to\r\n        signal agreement, disagreement, points of information, and points of order without interrupting or trampling anyone else\u2019s Voice.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nUnsurprisingly, General Assembly procedure also maximizes protections for Voice by regulating opportunities to speak. I\u2019ll quote from the        <a href=\"http://www.nycga.net/2011/10/26/1482/\">minutes</a> of the New York City General Assembly\u2019s October 26 meeting:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        We abide by two important principles. The first is that we take progressive stack. This means the stack taker will reorder the list of people who want\r\n        to speak by prioritizing traditionally marginalized voices. The second principle is a self-imposed principle called step-up, step-back. Take note of\r\n        the privilege in your life and if you have been traditionally encouraged to make your voice heard in society, we invite you to step back, and if you\r\n        have been traditionally discouraged from making your voice heard, we invite you to step up.\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <p>\r\n        These two principles exemplify the divergence between the mainstream American ideal of free speech and the Occupational Left\u2019s ideal of free speech.\r\n        Conservatives and moderate liberals might see this as affirmative action run amok, the victory of identity politics over Enlightenment rationalism,\r\n        historical inequality used to justify present inequality. Free speech, to them, means something like a net neutrality of the public domain; the\r\norganizing authority must be impartial towards all speakers and all messages. For the Occupiers, though, the most important thing is that        <i>everyone</i> be heard. Sacrificing organizational impartiality to protect Voice is almost no sacrifice at all.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        The people\u2019s mic, the consensus process, and the ideologically diverse crowd make the General Assembly a poor executive body. To the extent that this\r\n        has become a problem, the Occupiers\u2019 solutions are working groups and spokes councils. Working groups also operate through consensus and can\u2019t make\r\n        decisions without bringing them to the General Assembly. The Demands Working Group, for example, was formed shortly after the beginning of the\r\noccupation in Zucotti Park. After many long hours of discussion and argument, the group endorsed a short set of demands, which was then        <a href=\"http://www.nycga.net/2011/10/30/nycga-minutes-10302011/\">presented to the General Assembly on October 30</a>. It was tabled and has not\r\n        resurfaced. <a href=\"http://www.nycga.net/spokes-council/\">Spokes councils</a> are meetings that balance mass participation with small-group discussion\r\n        through a creative seating arrangement. The use of these tools rather than some form of representation is an attempt to make direct democracy scale\r\n        without losing any of its immediacy.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Despite the General Assembly\u2019s shortcomings, the Occupations are often held up as models of direct democracy, in contrast to the US government and\r\n        others. It is difficult to say what \u201cthe Occupiers\u201d think, of course, since they make no pretense of being ideologically unified, but it\u2019s safe to say\r\nthere is at least a broad current that feels our national government is illegitimate. From        <a href=\"http://www.nycga.net/2011/10/30/nycga-minutes-10302011/\">the debate</a> over the Demands Working Group\u2019s proposal:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        <b>Facilitator</b>\r\n        : We first have a P[oint] of I[information]. Demands validate the US government. [The proposal] seeks the US government to allow us what are our\r\n        rights.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b>Point of Process</b>\r\n        : There will be time for concerns. We are now opening stack for questions first, followed by concerns.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b>[</b>\r\n        \u2026]\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b>Clarifying Question</b>\r\n        : Although I agree we need a Demands group, my question is this: have you considered, by asking a criminal organization for jobs that they may very\r\n        well give you jobs for nuclear plants, military establishments, GMOs,\u2026?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b>Facilitator</b>\r\n        : Mic check!\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b>[</b>\r\n        \u2026]\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b>Clarifying Question</b>\r\n        : The demand reads: We demand \u201cdemocratically controlled\u201d etc. We do not acknowledge the legitimacy or democratic capabilities of any political party\r\n        presently existing to carry out our demands. We trust only ourselves.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b>[</b>\r\n        \u2026]\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b>Clarifying Question</b>\r\n        : It\u2019s unclear to me what it means that this is a demand. We\u2019re demanding from a government who you say we don\u2019t think is legitimate to meet these\r\n        demands. Are we demanding of ourselves, and if it\u2019s the government, what are we going to do if they don\u2019t do it? Are we going to leave if they do? What\r\n        is this?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b>Response</b>\r\n        : Perhaps one way we can answer this good question is this: Look around, this crowd is great but this is not the 99%. This is exclusivity, and the way\r\n        this demand is phrased can reach out and expand this struggle to parts of NYC that know nothing about this movement because for some reason, for some\r\n        it seems controversial to make a political point, which is, we demand of ourselves first of all, like we said in the preamble. Public education for\r\n        example is something we\u2019re fighting for in our movement, to make the movement broader, these demands can help us do this.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b>Clarifying Question</b>\r\n        : Could the presenters of this proposal clarify in what way it does not presuppose the legitimacy of the institutions to which the demand is made? As\r\n        far as I\u2019m aware, all revolutions started by making a demand to a state that could not fulfill them.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <b>Response</b>\r\n        : The legitimacy of the government does not matter. We cannot ignore that it exists and has a chokehold on us.\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Belief in the illegitimacy of the US government, if not universal among the Occupiers, was at least widespread enough to prevent the proposed demands\r\n        from passing. But if our government is illegitimate, what would a legitimate form of collective organization look like? The General Assembly would be\r\n        an obvious answer, but no one is proposing to reorganize the United States (pop. 312 million) as a giant General Assembly. If we assume a maximum\r\n        assembly size of 500 people, the US would have to be divided into 624,000 successor states in order to achieve the Assembly\u2019s level of direct\r\n        democracy, though few at the Occupations are proposing that either.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        This is not to say that our only choice is between our current, flawed representative democracy and the General Assembly. Of course there are countless\r\n        other possibilities, many of which would maintain various degrees of representative government while ensuring greater protections for Voice. But the\r\n        Occupiers as a group seem uninterested in these accommodations, none of which prioritizes Voice to the extent the Assembly does. Voice is the\r\n        Occupiers\u2019 primary and uncompromisable demand, but it\u2019s neither possible nor imaginable for an entire country to organize itself around Voice to the\r\n        extent the Occupations have, so they pass over the prospect of national change and focus on building villages to hold up to the world.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nWithin these villages, there seems to be widespread contentment with the pace of progress. As some Occupiers have declared,<a href=\"http://www.benjaminbdaniels.com/just-being-here-is-enough-2355\">\u201cjust being here is enough\u201d</a> and \u201c<a href=\"http://www.insidevandy.com/drupal/node/18327\">it\u2019s</a> <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/10/12/1025738/-Confessions-of-a-Retail-Worker:-Occupy-Wall-Street-is-already-a-success\">already</a> <a href=\"http://www.russellbrand.tv/2011/10/occupy/\">a success</a>.\u201d A few things you can do in Zucotti Park: You can take books out from the people\u2019s\r\n        library. You can work on or read the <a href=\"http://occupiedwallstjournal.com/\">Occupied Wall Street Journal</a>. You can interview others or be\r\n        interviewed for the nonstop online coverage. You can discuss politics and philosophy with people who have a wide range of opinions. You can create or\r\n        borrow signs to get your message out to the passing tourists. You can attend religious services. No one will stop you from speaking your opinions, no\r\n        matter what they are.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Zucotti Park has become a paradise of Voice, which its occupants hold and defend against the cold, the grime, the rain, the discomfort, the\r\n        interpersonal tensions, the police, and the skeptics. These and other hardships are the price of a visible location; if the Occupiers wanted only to\r\n        speak and hear amongst themselves, they could meet anywhere, but the central plazas they\u2019ve claimed in busy downtowns ensure a steady stream of press\r\n        coverage and political attention. How complete could a festival of free speech be if it went unheard by those outside? Judging by the Occupiers\u2019 deeds\r\n        rather than their declarations, their utopian project is to create a Voice-centered mini-society to present to the mainstream.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        It seems to me that this obsessive focus on Voice has been misunderstood by much of the left and center, which takes the Occupiers\u2019 signs and slogans\r\nabout greed and corruption at face value. In October, Mother Jones blogger Kevin Drum        <a href=\"http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/10/keep-asking-yourself-one-question-whose-side-am-i\">responded</a> to liberals dismayed by OWS\u2019s\r\n        ragged fringes by reminding them to ask themselves, \u201cWhose side am I on?\u201d An important question, and one the Occupiers should ask themselves as well.\r\n        They\u2019ve shown themselves to be on the side of mini-utopias and free-speech parks. But is that also the side of facing our broken world as it is and\r\n        trying to fix it? And if not, whose side are we on?\r\n<img src=\"/media/end.gif\">    </p>\r\n",

In kinetic terms, the\r\n        evil are defined by their ceaseless motion. The Sabbath is the work of bringing them to rest.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <blockquote>\r\n        <i>1. A song to be sung on the day of the Sabbath.</i>\r\n    </blockquote>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Psalm 92 does not talk much about the Sabbath. In fact, the above epigraph is the only mention it gets. Why, then, is this song to be sung on the day\r\n        of the Sabbath?\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        These epigraphs attached to psalms ought not to be trivialized. They are meant to inform us as to the psalms\u2019 intended setting. There are very few\r\n        psalmic epigraphs that invoke a specific cultic occasion the way this one does. It should be used as a hermeneutical key to the rest of the psalm.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\">Rashi</a>\r\n        explains, very succinctly, that this psalm is \u201cfor the Day that is All Sabbath.\u201d That is, it is about an ultimate culmination. The Sabbath, as it\r\n        recurs every week, is meant to be a prefiguration of the ultimate Sabbath, the timelessness at the end of time. Thus the Psalm of Sabbath is a dream\r\n        vision of how everything will look when the dust settles on history.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        There are two verses of praise for God\u2019s acts of creation: \u201c5. I am gladdened God by your works, in the work of your hands I do rejoice. 6. How great\r\n        are your deeds God, deep indeed are your designs.\u201d Then:\r\n    </p>\r\n    <blockquote><p>\r\n        <i>\r\n            7. A foolish man does not know, a buffoon cannot comprehend this. 8. When wicked people did flower like grass, when all workers of destruction did\r\n            blossom, it was so that they will be destroyed by the end. 9. But you are exalted forever God. 10. Here are your enemies God, here your enemies\r\n            will be vanquished, all workers of destruction will be scattered. 11. You have raised my horn like a wild ox, anointed me with good oil. 12. I will\r\n            keep my eye on those who are staring at me. When my antagonists rise up against me, I will be listening.\r\n        </i>\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        <i>\r\n            13. A righteous person will flower like a palm, like a cedar in Lebanon will he grow. 14. Rooted in the house of God, in the courts of our Lord\r\n            will he flower. 15. Still into their old age will they grow, green and full they will be. 16. To tell of how straightforward God is. He is my rock\r\n            and there is nothing crooked in Him.\r\n        </i>\r\n    </p></blockquote>\r\n    <p>\r\n        There is a cast of characters in this psalm about the Sabbath. Their presence may not be explicit, but they are crucial to an understanding of the\r\n        ideological system of the psalm and the way in which the Sabbath fits in.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        CREATION: Creation is the subject of verses 5 and 6, the works, deeds, and designs of God. Creation itself is a victory, it is God\u2019s defeat of the\r\n        powers of chaos. Since creation itself is perpetually recurring, so is the insurrection of chaos. Creation does not always reassert itself in imitation\r\n        of its beginning\u2014it changes as it replicates. That is, chaos remains an impending threat against it. The cessation of creation recurs along with\r\n        re-creation: this is the Sabbath.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        RIGHTEOUSNESS: Righteousness is the concluding sentiment of the psalm: <i>God is straightforward\u2026 there is nothing crooked in him.</i> The fact of\r\n        creation is evidence of righteousness; righteousness is creation\u2019s prevailing tendency. That is, ultimately, it will prevail. The Sabbath is also said\r\n        to be an expression of the right. This does at least make sense as a logical progression from the connection between Sabbath and creation, merely by\r\n        the transitive property. But how the relation actually works is not immediately clear.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        THE WICKED: The wicked are the subject of verses 7, 8, and 10. They oppose righteousness and therefore are also an attack on creation. They are twice\r\n        characterized as <i>workers of destruction</i>, which is surely meant to contrast with the creative works of God which gladden the heart of the\r\n        psalmist in verse 5. Wicked people, it is implied, undo the work of creation with their evils. Notice the thematic botanical consistency of the success\r\n        and demise of the wicked: in their success they flourish like grass, so naturally their demise is a kind of scattering. On the eve of the Day that is\r\n        All Sabbath, God will mow the lawn of wicked people.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        THE RIGHTEOUS: The righteous are spoken of in verses 13-15. Their success, unlike the success of evil, is phrased in the future tense. The righteous\r\n        will flower as the wicked did flower, but note the remarkable contrast: the wicked in their growth are compared to grass, the righteous to a cedar of\r\n        Lebanon. While grass withers and vanishes capriciously, cedars grow sturdily in the most precarious of places. The success of the righteous cedar is\r\n        rooted in the way it establishes a place for itself (the house of God, v. 14).\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        There is a kinetic logic to this psalm that highlights the dichotomy between rest and motion. The wicked are ever restless even in their flourishing,\r\n        while the righteous achieve a kind of sabbatical stillness, a fixedness of orientation with regard to space. But what exactly is the connection between\r\n        the orientation of righteousness and fidelity to the Sabbath? Is the Sabbath merely a matter of subordinating your interests to those of God? As though\r\n        it were a kind of tithing of your time and productivity? Or can it be said to have actual righteous content?\r\n    </p>\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n    <p>\r\n        Like the sense of evil, the sense of the Sabbath is a specific kind of motion, or, better, a specific kind of rest. It is a debate over the proper\r\n        description of this motion that occupies the following teaching:</p> \r\n<blockquote>All of his days, Shammai the elder would do his eating as an honor to the Sabbath. He\r\n        would find a good-looking animal and say: this one is for the Sabbath [i.e. to be eaten then]. If he were to find a more attractive animal, he would\r\n        rest the second and eat the first. But Hillel the elder had a different tendency: all of his actions were in heaven\u2019s name. As it is said: Bless God\r\n        day after day (Psalm 68). Another teaching: Shammai would say, all of your days are together for the Sabbath; Hillel would say, bless God day after\r\n        day. (TB Beitzah 16a.)</blockquote>\r\n    <p>\r\n        If the weekly Sabbath is a window into the world to come, the Day that is All Sabbath, and the days of the week are metonyms for the present reality of\r\nwork, then our dynamics of preparation and culmination are themselves metonyms of our stance towards present effort and utopian aspiration. Both        <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillel_and_Shammai\">Hillel and Shammai</a> understand this. Hillel declares that utopia has to begin now; he is\r\n        our example of it. If only everyone could stand in such a position of total trust in God, our entire present system of feast and famine, lack and\r\n        fulfillment, would be overturned. That is Hillel\u2019s revolution. Shammai appears to be more conservative. Work while it\u2019s time to work, defer your\r\n        pleasures till the time comes for them. The Sabbath derives its power from everything that is not immediately consumed. It builds a cyclical structure\r\n        within time for articulating licit and illicit pleasures. Unlike for Hillel, for Shammai to eat his prize beast on a regular day is <i>offensive</i> to\r\n        God, instead of an expression of trust and perpetual delight. Notice, though, the crucial function that this prize beast serves in Shammai\u2019s\r\n        construction of Sabbath. It is the Sabbath animal in two respects. Firstly, it is the object of consumption for the Sabbath. But notice how Shammai\r\n        \u2018rests\u2019 the animal that he finds to be the best. It is the avatar of the principle of rest, in which the Sabbath is invested while we go about our\r\n        business. The very fact of its separated, exalted existence shapes our experience, giving it the imprint of Sabbath even when the Sabbath is absent.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\nThis difference between Shammai and Hillel can be viewed from another angle as well, from within the Sabbath. The first chapter of        <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat_Talmud\">Mishnah Shabbat</a> records a series of disputes between the students of Shammai and those of\r\n        Hillel with regard to the extent of the principle of rest.\r\n    </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Beit Shammai says, you may not soak dyes, paints, or horse feed prior to the Sabbath unless they will be properly soaked beforehand; Beit Hillel\r\n        permits.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Beit Shammai says, you may not put bundles of wet flax in the oven unless they have time to dry while it is still day. Nor may you put wool into the\r\n        dyer\u2019s vat unless it might be dyed while it is still day; Beit Hillel permits.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Beit Shammai says, you may not set out traps for beasts or birds or fish prior to the Sabbath unless they are expected to trap before sundown; Beit\r\n        Hillel permits.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        \u2026Beit Shammai says, you may not give skins to be worked nor give clothing to an alien launderer, unless enough time before the Sabbath is allowed; Beit\r\n        Hillel permits as long as the sun is up. (Mishnah Shabbat 1:4-8)\r\n    </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n    <p>\r\n        These disputes can be read as expressing a basic difference in the interpretation of this biblical injunction: \u201cdo no labor: you, your son, your\r\n        daughter, your servants, and your cattle, as well as the stranger that is in your gates\u201d (Exodus 20:9). For what reason must you allow your cattle to\r\n        rest, since they not only do not have any individual obligation in that regard, but also have no conception of the Sabbath at all? Beit Hillel thinks\r\n        that despite this cognitive incapacity, cattle are deserving of rest by way of their membership in the fellowship of living beings. They need the\r\n        Sabbath in the same way that you do. Beit Shammai, on the other hand, sees \u2018cattle\u2019 as shorthand for \u2018everything that is within your control.\u2019 Thus, as\r\n        is demonstrated above, Beit Shammai extends the principle of rest indiscriminately to inanimate and animate objects as long as they are within one\u2019s\r\n        sphere of control. Beit Shammai does not need to believe that the dyes experience rest in order to extend the Sabbath to them. There is something about\r\n        the presence of even non-subjective labor activity that compromises the Sabbath.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        The content of this position is to be found in that in-between period, one interval of several days, where between being an object of labor and an\r\n        object of consumption, the sabbatical beast is an object of rest. For a brief period, this animal is exempted from the normal economic conditions which\r\n        govern its existence\u2014it is set aside in the name of Sabbath. At the top of the page which introduces the Sabbath animal, the <i>gemara</i> expresses a\r\n        similar sentiment: \u201cAll of the sustenance which one will receive is fixed from the beginning of the year to the end of the year, with the exception of\r\n        what is spent for the Sabbath, the holidays, and educating one\u2019s child in the ways of Torah.\u201d It is thought that at the beginning of every year, one\u2019s\r\n        material income for that entire year is determined in advance. There is nothing one can do to overturn that sentence. The Sabbath itself is meant to be\r\n        an escape from the fatalistic economic logic of normal life. Hillel and Shammai both agree, it\u2019s just that Hillel himself is host to the sabbatical\r\n        principle, where Shammai invests it in an external being. There is a similar sort of shift in verb form in the mishnaic dispute. Hillel rests, Shammai\r\n        brings to rest. For Hillel, explicitly, something can continue to operate as your instrument of labor during the Sabbath, as long as you are not its\r\n        operator. Shammai would not allow this.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Given this, I postulate a paradigmatic difference between Shammai and Hillel. The school of Hillel believes the Sabbath to be primarily something that\r\n        human beings are doing; the school of Shammai believes it to be something God is doing. For the humanist, the Sabbath is invested with a set of\r\n        responsibilities and duties that must be attended to. The pre-humanist theological perspective imagines the entirety of creation (that is, everything)\r\n        being orchestrated into God\u2019s weekly reenactment of that original moment of pause.\r\n    </p>\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n    <h3>\r\n        Coda on the General Strike\r\n    </h3>\r\n    <p>\r\n        This divine decree of cessation generates a sacred space that is beyond labor relations. A world at rest suggests a universal ground for being that is\r\n        prior to the logic of domination: the Sabbath animal does nothing for you except remind you of this.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        There are two important consequences to this cessation. Firstly, it suspends relations of domination between all agents, subjective and non-subjective,\r\n        and thereby renders them conspicuous. Secondly, it establishes a new mode of relatedness between agents, particular to sabbatical exception. Which is\r\n        to say, even as relations of labor are suspended, some manner of relation does take its place. Agents remain attached to each other in what I would\r\n        term an empathic-connective resting. This relatedness is encoded by a very close attention to <i>not</i> doing.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        What is this sabbatical relatedness? It is not the case that things turn inward onto themselves in a state of rest. It has often been suspected that\r\n        the Sabbath is a thin cloak for indolence. Or, more subtly, that it is nothing but lack\u2014not doing, non-involvement. From a moral framework that makes\r\n        judgments in terms of individual responsibility and effort, the Sabbath is inexcusable. It is an abstention from the striving that perpetuates\r\n        existence.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n        Hence the analogy to the General Strike. By forcing a total stop, the strike brings to light the tight-wound interdependence of all regions of\r\n        circulation and all sectors of labor. And both are similarly misunderstood by their enemies as purely negative. How can you stop when there is so much\r\n        work to do? What these critics miss is the regenerative power of cessation. It works to completely change things before they begin again.\r\n    </p>\r\n",

Its name, meaning \u201cavenues,\u201d was bestowed in the 1950s to evoke the busy streets and rows of trees that would signal the fulfillment of the Zionist dream of \u201cmaking the desert bloom.\u201d It lies partly on the land of the defunct Arab city of Najd, whose residents fled or were expelled to the coast after the area was captured by Jewish Defense forces in 1948. The city was originally home mostly to Kurdish and Persian Jews fleeing Iran, Iraq, and Turkey, followed by Moroccan Jews and, most recently, ex-Soviet and Ethiopian Jews. In 1997, a number of Palestinian Arabs relocated to Sderot from Gaza after the discovery of their collaborations with Israeli intelligence made it impossible to remain in their communities. Sderot is best known as a frequent target for rockets launched by terrorist groups in Gaza. In 2000, the town\u2019s population was about 24,000; today it is closer to 19,000. Despite its size, it is known darkly by some Israelis as \u201cthe biggest bull's-eye on the map of Israel.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is easy to forget just how tiny a space is taken up by Israel and the Palestinian territories. The width of Israel between the westernmost point of the northern West Bank and the Mediterranean is approximately the same distance as my morning commute. Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Al Aqsa Brigades, and other terrorist groups began launching Qassam rockets at Sderot in 2001 as part of the Second Intifada (2000-2005) and have continued since then, though irregularly and sometimes haltingly. During the first eight years, 10,000 rockets fell in the western Negev, an average of more than three per day. Rocket fire intensified with the Hamas takeover of Gaza in 2007 and ebbed after Israel\u2019s intense bombing campaign in Gaza in the winter of 2008-2009 known as Operation Cast Lead. Today, rockets are much rarer than they were just a few years ago. At its worst, 300 rockets fell on Sderot in a two week period in May 2007, or 21 per day. As of the original drafting of this article (November 3), the most recent rocket attack on Sderot was five days ago, though a number of others have hit surrounding areas more recently.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn 2002, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) installed a radar warning system known as <i>Shakhar Adom</i>, or \u2018red dawn,\u2019 which sounds an alarm throughout the town when a rocket is inbound. In 2007, the name was changed to <i>Tseva Adom</i>, or \u2018red color,\u2019 after a seven-year-old Israeli girl named Shakhar complained. Once the alarm begins, people typically have 15 seconds to find shelter before the rocket makes impact. Residents determine ahead of time which parts of their houses are safest, and the town map is dotted with public bomb shelters. <i>The use of seat belts is forbidden in Sderot.</i> Those 15 seconds are too precious. No one showers or listens to headphones in their houses unless someone else is home to hear the alarms. Those who walk the street are reluctant to stray more than a few yards from the shelters. In 2005, the radar warning system was installed in the city of Ashkelon, which lies north of the Gaza Strip near the Mediterranean coast. Ashkelonites live further away from Gaza than Sderotites, and have 30 seconds\u2019 warning instead of 15.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSince Operation Cast Lead, which largely wiped out the terrorist infrastructures (and significant civilian infrastructures) in Gaza, the attacks have slowed considerably, shifting the attention of the Israeli public from the rockets themselves to the effects that they\u2019ve wrought on the people of Sderot. Particular attention has been focused on the town\u2019s children. Nearly all of them have witnessed a rocket\u2019s moment of impact or its immediate aftermath. According to a study performed in July of this year, 70% of Sderotite children exhibit at least one symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder. Half of them periodically relive the trauma, and 40 percent suffer from hyperactivity\u2014they are constantly alert, and the slightest disturbance makes them shudder or shake. Many of them have ADHD. In the spring of 2001, 44 percent of twelfth-graders failed to graduate from high school because of poor academic performance. The study mentions an 11-year-old girl who has been in therapy for three years to treat her severe PTSD, yet, according to her parents and therapists, her suffering has only <i>worsened</i>. According to one of the scientists involved in <a href=\u201chttp://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4093281,00.html\u201d>this year\u2019s study</a>, many children \u201cstop playing, stop being interested in their surroundings, detach themselves from their friends and school.\u201d He continues, \u201cOne of our newest and most interesting findings is that there is a connection between the symptoms that the parents experience and the ones their children experience.\u201d Now, two and a half years after the rocket attacks slowed to a trickle, 33% of Sderot residents, both children and adults, suffer from clinical PTSD. 20% of children suffer from <i>every symptom</i> of PTSD. A quarter of the population takes anti-depressant medication. Some take sleeping pills.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere is a yawning gap between, on the one hand, this almost absurdly grim picture of a town under a stark psychological menace, and on the other, the bare casualty figures of the rocket attacks. In the last decade, 25 Israelis in the western Negev have actually been killed and about 700 injured by Qassams from Gaza, fewer in the town of Sderot itself. Those figures aren\u2019t truly very remarkable. Casualties have been surprisingly low relative to the outright suffering of rocket survivors, largely because the technology used to launch the rockets themselves has terrible aim. Many of the rockets don\u2019t even strike populated areas. Instead, the sight of burning cars and destroyed property, the unmistakable sound of the alarm system (a high tone, a pause, high, low, and then a female voice urging, <i>tseva adom! tseva adom!</i>), and the knowledge that it not only <i>could</i> but <i>will</i> happen again tomorrow\u2014all of this imposes an unshakeable paralysis over the sunny, tree-laden town of twenty thousand people.\r\n</p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Sderot Media Center is a nonprofit that aims to increase awareness of the Qassam attacks in the western Negev among consumers of international media, especially in Europe and the United States. It describes itself as \u201cfounded with the purpose of uncovering the voices of a population marginalized by the conflict,\u201d and its aim is also to \u201cpromote a pro-Israel attitude in the western and international media.\u201d Nearly every website offering information on Sderot and the Qassam saga points out, in that tone that mixes indignation with sobriety, that these facts are dramatically \u201cunderreported\u201d in non-Israeli media.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe claim of journalistic bias hitches its wagon immediately and seamlessly to the claim of underreporting. The difference between an \u201cunreported\u201d datum and a \u201ccensored\u201d one is easily elided on the basis of a century of training in mistrust of the media.  This mistrust is factored into reportage itself, along with a calculus of underreportage. A fact is included out of responsibility to the reading (democratic) public, which is vulnerable to na\u00efvet\u00e9 (and dangerous) if underinformed. An unobtrusive article on the Israeli-Palestine conflict, to the extent that such is possible, would take care with quantities of reportedness: \u201cunder\u201d and \u201cover\u201d already designate this quantitative aspect.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut in particular, such an article would concern itself with <i>relative</i> quantities of reportedness. What's matters, what incites indignation, is not just underreportage of the conflict, but also relative underreportage of Israeli and of Palestinian suffering. Why? This intricacy does not follow directly from the calculus of suspicion already factored into journalism. It is a particularly agentivist modification of that suspicion: Since the violence is going unnarrated, someone must be suppressing it. Who would this \u201csomeone\u201d be, if not an already-extant political lobby and agenda\u2014which sides with the Israelis, which sides with the Palestinians? Not only a calculus of underreportage, but a preexisting mainstream-political rancor, which gives mistrust a face, is already factored into an unobtrusive, <i>balanced</i> reportage.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut a second register is at play, simultaneously, which is, if still journalistic, in goal less informative than testimonial or representational, in medium less factual than narrative. The SMC tells us that \u201cthe people under siege in Sderot and the Western Negev want to tell their story.\u201d  Story and voice remain within the same polemical field as reportage, representing facts through individual cases that can more effectively \u201cgenerate empathy\u201d\u2014another goal of Sderot Media Center. Here not only information but also emotion is caught in the net of \u201cbalance.\u201d Indeed, once again, we find that the calculus of balance is already factored in, not only into a critical stance towards reportage, but also into any emotion that might appear in this field. Empathies are to be balanced, one against the other, or else framed with advisory. Failure to do so will be obtrusive.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThus our choices are given in such a way that a reader is forced to displace horror into either a formulation of judgment against one party or an expression of sorrow for both, or to deny the violence (suffered by either or both parties) through minimization and rationalization. That is, violence cannot be dwelt on. Instead, through these determinations of balance and the various subtleties in narrative tones they produce, journalism engages in one form or another of mourning that, far from \u201cconfronting\u201d violence, brings the horror to an end by discharging its impact elsewhere, through judgment, compassion, or denial. In this light, I am compelled to look for alternatives to these expressions, to suggest a more desirable way in which to confront violence, and indeed, in which to read the stories of Sderot. To take it all in, but to recognize the tug of pathos, and to pull back on it, and thus rather than resolving the horror, hold it in suspension? To face it with incredulity, nausea, awe, pain, or catharsis? Won\u2019t this require experimentation? And, for such a journalist, what a strange integrity! <img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n<p>\r\n<div style=\"font-family: verdana, Sans Serif; font-size: 9pt; color: #666666; text-align: right;\">[Austin Gross contributed to this article.]</div><br>",

Cordelia\u2019s Honesty</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nFreud\u2019s beautiful essay on <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> and <i>King Lear,</i> <a href = http://www.essex.ac.uk/centres/psycho/prospective/pg/The%20Theme%20of%20the%20Three%20Caskets%20by%20Sigmund%20Freud_Standard%20Edition%20Vol%20XII_pages%20291%20to%20301.pdf> \u201cThe Theme of the Three Caskets,\u201d</a> rebukes the purveyors of a merely prudential reading of <i>Lear</i> as follows:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nTo avoid misunderstandings, I should like to say that it is not my purpose to deny that King Lear's dramatic story is intended to inculcate two wise lessons: that one should not give up one's possessions and rights during one's lifetime, and that one must guard against accepting flattery at its face value. These and similar warnings are undoubtedly brought out by the play; but it seems to me quite impossible to explain the overpowering effect of <i>King Lear</i> [thus]... Lear is not only an old man: he is a dying man. Eternal wisdom, clothed in the primeval myth, bids the old man renounce love, choose death, and make friends with the necessity of dying.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI suppose that few of us nowadays would dare read Shakespeare with quite the moral satisfaction which Freud here rejects. And yet such a reading of <i>Lear</i> is not thoroughly dead; it comes naturally. Lear appears, more than any of Shakespeare\u2019s other tragic heroes, to possess a tragic flaw. It would be laughable to understand the hypnotic fascination with which Macbeth pursues to the end his own damnation, or the black beak with which Othello tears his heart, as some sort of mistake; and Hamlet draws the question of error down with him in his fall. But with Lear\u2014and this is what makes him so much more lovable than the others\u2014we think we see what\u2019s wrong. Lear is childish. He wants to amuse himself, and he wants to be loved.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFreud argues that Lear\u2019s failure lies elsewhere. In banishing Cordelia, he isn\u2019t just turning his back on just counsel and inviting flattery; he\u2019s turning his back on death itself, seeking to cling to the last dregs of his life. His choice thus becomes both more desperate and more comprehensible. Freud is characteristically attuned to the way in which every moral choice rests on a prior renunciation, an acceptance of finitude and indeed of failure which will always remain unredeemed; he sees in Lear\u2019s choice not a determinate error but a titanic refusal, a crack in the wall separating the limited order of the state from the dark wilderness of the passions. From this refusal every disaster is to be expected, none more naturally than the death of the one Lear loves most.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut does Lear really expect to cheat death? Can the actions with which he opens the play be understood thus? Hardly. He is a good deal more clear-sighted than that. His decision to \u201cretire\u201d is no attempt to claw his way back to a second childhood; he wishes, he says, \r\n<blockquote>To shake all cares and business from our age,<br>\r\nConferring them on younger strengths while we<br>\r\nUnburthen'd crawl toward death.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nLear is over 80 years old, and he knows well that he will die; his retirement is an acceptance of this. If there is something that Lear refuses, it lies elsewhere.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Lear\u2019s Choice</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nSo what is it that Lear rejects? It is Cordelia who recognizes immediately the point at issue. In the opening scene of <i>Lear,</i> Lear asks each of his daughters to express how much she loves him so that he can divide his kingdom among them accordingly. After her two sisters have given predictably and embarrassingly effusive answers to this question\u2014Goneril says he is more to her than every other joy in her life, Regan that without him she could know no joy\u2014Cordelia answers as follows:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>Good my lord, <br>\r\nYou have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; I<br>\r\nReturn those duties back as are right fit, <br>\r\nObey you, love you, and most honour you. <br>\r\nWhy have my sisters husbands, if they say<br>\r\nThey love you all? Haply, when I shall wed, <br>\r\nThat lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry<br>\r\nHalf my love with him, half my care and duty. <br>\r\nSure I shall never marry like my sisters, <br>\r\nTo love my father all.</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCordelia\u2019s answer is deeply impressive in its moral probity; it is also frighteningly merciless. She answers Lear\u2019s question through an appeal to duty, as though to love him were merely her job. Her sisters claimed that their love knew no bounds, that it was as big as the world; Cordelia sets on her love precise limits. To love thus would be immoral, according to her: Love exists within a symbolic order, an economy of exchange, and love which seeks to transgress this order debases itself and the beloved. Cordelia sees that Lear, at the moment when he is abandoning his duties as father and king and preparing to leave the world of the living, wishes to be loved as more than a father and more than a king\u2014and she rebukes him. A king is replaced by his successor, a father replaced by a husband, and Lear too will be replaced. Cordelia sees clearly that he wishes to be exempt from the law of passage, and refuses with an honesty which borders on cruelty to pretend that this can be. She tells him, in effect: \u201cI love you as a father, and you have no right to demand more than that; I will not die with you.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShe is wrong, though; she will.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Lear\u2019s Desire</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt this point, in light of Lear\u2019s shocked reaction to Cordelia\u2019s words and of the endless disasters which ensue, it\u2019s worth asking: What in God\u2019s name did he expect to happen? Did he really think that by putting his kingdom up for sale to the daughter who flattered him best he would receive anything but sentimental lies and real contempt from his hypocritical and power-hungry elder daughters? Was he capable of believing that his extraordinarily clear-eyed and strong-willed youngest daughter, the apple of his eye, would reduce herself to participating in this vile competition? Lear may have been mad, but surely he was not such a fool.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo why did Lear organize this scene whose tragic consequences ought to have been visible from the outset? One obvious answer suggests itself: He wanted to be lied to. Such an intention may seem paradoxical, but it is by no means rare; I\u2019d wager that you yourself, dear reader, have at one time or another asked someone you loved to lie to you. Lear is over 80 years old, crawling, as he does not fail to point out, towards death and oblivion; he will sacrifice his power and his throne, he will prepare himself, but he desires in return a comforting lie to lean on. Is that too much to ask?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf this was Lear\u2019s plan, he did not reckon with his youngest daughter. But I would like to suggest, speculatively, that he did\u2014that he knew in a certain sense what Cordelia would answer before he asked. After all, Lear chooses his daughters\u2019 marriage as the occasion for his retirement. He knows well that, whatever they might say to the contrary, he is about to lose them. The very wrath with which he responds to Cordelia\u2019s words surely suggests that he recognizes their truth; and at some level, he must have known that his demand for a lie would provoke this truth. What Lear cannot accept in death is that it will visit only him, while life will go on elsewhere. In this sense, all his daughters will betray him; Cordelia is just the only one willing to admit it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tLear\u2019s fall begins with his question to his daughters\u2014but Lear is a dying man, and he will fall whatever he does. In light of this, his question is a success, and doubly so. In Cordelia\u2019s answer, he renders public and visible a truth which he cannot bear alone; in the total collapse which follows from his actions, he drags his whole court with him towards his doom. If we are to decide whether Lear is the befuddled failure he seems to be, we ought to ask what success might mean to the dying.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. The Storm</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nLear forces his betrayal because he wishes to make it both absolute and visible. It finds its visibility in the storm he flees towards. The howling night of Act III, the \u201copen night\u201d whose tyranny is \u201ctoo rough for nature to endure,\u201d as Kent says\u2014is the dark core of <i>Lear,</i> and perhaps the most unforgettable space in Shakespeare. \u201cThings that love night / Love not such nights as these\u201d\u2014Kent again\u2014but Lear, at least, loves this night. \r\n</p>\r\n <blockquote>Lear. Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow! <br>\r\n    You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout<br>\r\n    Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks! <br>\r\n    You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires, <br>\r\n    Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts, <br>\r\n    Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder, <br>\r\n    Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world, <br>\r\n    Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once, <br>\r\n    That makes ingrateful man!</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nLear curses beautifully throughout the play, and always in vain. In the first two acts he has already cursed Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, and Kent; these curses mark both his foolishness and his impotence. A king can avenge the wrongs done him, but Lear is no longer king, and he can only curse. His dark and terrible words fall on deaf ears. In the first scene his most loyal servant, Kent, tells him as much:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote><b>Lear.</b> Now by Apollo-<br>\r\n <b>Kent.</b> Now by Apollo, King, <br>\r\n    Thou swear'st thy gods in vain. <br>\r\n <b>Lear.</b> O vassal! miscreant!</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nLear\u2019s words in the storm are different\u2014more abstract and more complete. Having failed to curse his ungrateful daughters, he curses the whole world; having lost his position and his name, he demands the destruction of every position and the disappearance of all names. Here at last he has found an ally he can trust: the night which will suck him in and drown everything with him. The storm, of course, does not hear Lear\u2019s words any more than the absent gods do\u2014but this is what Lear loves in it.\r\n</p>\r\n <blockquote><b>Lear.</b> Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain! <br>\r\nNor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters. <br>\r\nI tax not you, you elements, with unkindness. <br>\r\nI never gave you kingdom, call'd you children, <br>\r\nYou owe me no subscription. Then let fall<br>\r\nYour horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave, <br>\r\nA poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nNature, because it knows no loyalty, is incapable of the betrayal within all loyalty. It is in the inhuman and un-Christian apocalypse of Act III, in the innocence of nature, that Lear finds his true ally and achieves his full stature. But it is a stature he cannot sustain. Immediately after praising nature for its difference from his daughters, he complains of an unholy alliance between the two:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n    <blockquote>But yet I call you servile ministers, <br>\r\n    That will with two pernicious daughters join<br>\r\n    Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head<br>\r\n    So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nLear cannot lose himself in the universality of death; his own troubles are too pressing. This, indeed, is why he has a fool. The Fool enacts a constant parody of Lear\u2019s metaphysical urge, his will toward a general doom, by reminding us incessantly of Lear\u2019s <i>foolishness\u2014</i>the specific acts that placed him where he is. If Lear wants death to be general and entire, the Fool reminds him that this universality will not erase his particular. The parodic side of the Fool is nowhere as evident as in the Fool\u2019s take on eschatology, which closes the scene which opens with Lear\u2019s demand for apocalypse:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote><b>Fool.</b> This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak a\r\n    prophecy ere I go: <br>\r\n         When priests are more in word than matter; <br>\r\n         When brewers mar their malt with water; <br>\r\n         When nobles are their tailors' tutors, <br>\r\n         No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors; <br>\r\n         When every case in law is right, <br>\r\n         No squire in debt nor no poor knight; <br>\r\n         When slanders do not live in tongues, <br>\r\n         Nor cutpurses come not to throngs; <br>\r\n         When usurers tell their gold i' th' field, <br>\r\n         And bawds and whores do churches build: <br>\r\n         Then shall the realm of Albion<br>\r\n         Come to great confusion. <br>\r\n         Then comes the time, who lives to see't, <br>\r\n         That going shall be us'd with feet. <br>\r\n    This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cThis prophecy Merlin shall make\u201d\u2014Lear, after all, lived long before King Arthur\u2019s time, which in turn is long before ours. The apocalypse Lear desires, the world consumed by its own iniquity and swallowed by the sea, seems always in the offing but will never arrive. And so we\u2019re returned to our particular fates. Lear\u2019s affection for the Fool works against the awful clarity of his madness:\r\n</p>\r\n <blockquote><b>Lear.</b> Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold? <br>\r\n    I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow? <br>\r\n    The art of our necessities is strange, <br>\r\n    That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel. <br>\r\n    Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart<br>\r\n    That's sorry yet for thee.</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the end it is the Fool\u2019s chilliness which draws Lear from the wilderness and gives him the sense to come in out of the rain.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Section 5: Edgar and Mortification</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nIf Lear\u2019s flight into the wilderness is more voluntary than it might at first appear, Edgar\u2019s is so willing as to constitute an obvious problem. When Kent is banished, he goes into disguise and immediately makes himself useful; when Edgar finds himself in a similar position, he refuses use absolutely:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote><b>Edgar:</b> ...Whiles I may scape, <br>\r\n    I will preserve myself; and am bethought<br>\r\n    To take the basest and most poorest shape<br>\r\n    That ever penury, in contempt of man, <br>\r\n    Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth, <br>\r\n    Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots, <br>\r\n    And with presented nakedness outface<br>\r\n    The winds and persecutions of the sky. <br>\r\n    The country gives me proof and precedent<br>\r\n    Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices, <br>\r\n    Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms<br>\r\n    Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary; <br>\r\n    And with this horrible object, from low farms, <br>\r\n    Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills, <br>\r\n    Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers, <br>\r\n    Enforce their charity. 'Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!'<br>\r\n    That's something yet! Edgar I nothing am.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tThough both Edgar and Lear choose after their betrayals to \u201coutface / The winds and persecutions of the sky,\u201d Edgar\u2019s attitude is the precise opposite of Lear\u2019s. Where Lear identifies himself with nature as the force which will consume the human, Edgar decides to be the human so consumed. He practices a mortification of the flesh and spirit without ennoblement: not only will he assume bare life, he will render such life visible. Lear tries to choose apotheosis in the very place where Edgar seeks humiliation. Edgar's constant prating, even when faced with the mad Lear and his own blind father, gets under his own skin as much as it gets under ours\u2014but the path he has chosen requires it. He will play his own fool. Faced with the horror of betrayal, Edgar refuses to be tragic. Or at any rate he tries.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tEdgar\u2019s attempt to flee the irredeemable betrayal of man\u2019s world in the anonymity of nature comes to grief in the particular, just as Lear\u2019s does. At the moment when he thinks he has made his escape, even as he is cheerfully claiming that he has nothing left to lose, he sees his father, Gloucester, blinded and betrayed, and recognizes that he can\u2019t escape. There follows the strangest and most farcical episode in <i>Lear:</i> Gloucester, failing to recognize his son, asks the crazy beggar to lead him to the cliffs of Dover so that he can bury his grief and guilt in the sea. The disguised Edgar, instead of revealing himself and providing comfort to his poor father, agrees to do just that\u2014then leads his father to a little hill, lets him jump, and tells him (still without revealing himself) that he was saved from death by a miracle. Gloucester on this basis agrees wearily to live until the gods choose to let him die. (He dies, in fact, an act later, of joy\u2014when Edgar finally sees fit to reveal himself.)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tEdgar\u2019s behavior towards his father constitutes an inverted commentary on Cordelia\u2019s behavior towards Lear. Gloucester, like Lear, has opted for \u201cearly retirement\u201d; Edgar, unlike Cordelia, talks him down from it with pious lies. Edgar\u2019s sense that Gloucester has a duty to live is utterly unjustified by anything in the play\u2014<i>Lear</i> takes place before the advent of Christianity and contains not a single reference to God, nor does it suggest any immanent reason to live. Edgar insists on his father\u2019s duty to await the pleasure of the gods with an empty and melancholy Stoicism; between the impossible wilderness of nature and the ubiquitous iniquity of man\u2019s world, there is simply nothing left to us but a duty with no touch of the sublime.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWithout Hamlet\u2019s brilliance, Edgar nonetheless partakes of Hamlet\u2019s shadow in this sense. After a play\u2019s worth of malingering, he reveals himself and assumes his name again in order to fight his brother. He avenges his father and himself\u2014not so that good will triumph over evil, for those who have witnessed Lear\u2019s fall can scarcely think this true, but out of a sense of obligation to his name and place.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Section 6: A Reckoning</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nWhile Gloucester and Edgar wander the wilderness together, Cordelia\u2019s attempt to save her father has failed, and she and Lear are captured. Lear\u2019s words on the occasion give the lie to every simply moral reading of the play:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote><b>Lear.</b> No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison. <br>\r\nWe two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage. <br>\r\nWhen thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down<br>\r\nAnd ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live, <br>\r\nAnd pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh<br>\r\nAt gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues<br>\r\nTalk of court news; and we'll talk with them too\u2014<br>\r\nWho loses and who wins; who's in, who's out\u2014<br>\r\nAnd take upon 's the mystery of things, <br>\r\nAs if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out, <br>\r\nIn a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones<br>\r\nThat ebb and flow by th' moon. <br>\r\n...\r\nHave I caught thee? <br>\r\nHe that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven<br>\r\nAnd fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes. <br>\r\nThe goodyears shall devour 'em, flesh and fell, <br>\r\nEre they shall make us weep! We'll see 'em starv'd first. <br>\r\n    Come.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\tLear has \u201clearned\u201d nothing in the course of the play; what he desired in the beginning, he simply welcomes at the end. His daughter, a married woman and queen of France, is to live out her days in prison with him because she insisted on trying to save him? What could be better? The incredible irresponsibility of Lear in these lines, his total failure to recognize the depth of his guilt, suggests how futile were Cordelia\u2019s efforts to rebuke him in the first act; he has no reason to hear her and will not. He is happy to see her imprisoned and will follow her soon to her death.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tBy the end of <i>King Lear,</i> Lear, Cordelia, Gloucester, Regan, Goneril, Edmund, Cornwall, and even the Fool are dead. Three characters remain on stage: Kent, Lear\u2019s loyal servant; Albany, Goneril\u2019s husband, who has assumed the crown; and Edgar. The last lines of the play are as follows:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote><b>Albany:</b> Bear them from hence. Our present business<br>\r\nIs general woe. [To Kent and Edgar] Friends of my soul, you twain<br>\r\nRule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain. <br>\r\n<b>Kent:</b> I have a journey, sir, shortly to go. <br>\r\nMy master calls me; I must not say no. <br>\r\n<b>Edgar:</b> The weight of this sad time we must obey, <br>\r\nSpeak what we feel, not what we ought to say. <br>\r\nThe oldest have borne most; we that are young<br>\r\nShall never see so much, nor live so long.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlbany, whose impotent moralizing came far too late to avoid the disaster, can do nothing but mourn; Kent, whose only real characteristic is loyalty, knows his last duty too well. The last four lines are given to Albany in the Quarto and to Edgar in the Folio\u2014but they are manifestly Edgar\u2019s, and very strange. The play has done everything to justify the contention of its wicked characters that the old are incompetent, easily fooled, and entirely unfit to rule; what is it they \u201csee\u201d that the young don\u2019t? Edgar, who will assume the crown Lear abandoned, is alone qualified to say. Lear and Gloucester know the endless betrayal of the world which consumes every duty; Edgar knows this too, but he knows that since there is no escape from this, no other world but the mortals\u2019, we must not speak of it. Edgar is the exemplary witness to the tragedy of Lear: he stares it in the face, then turns away.<img src=\"/media/end.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n",

            "rendered_content": "<h3>\r\nAuthenticity and the Middle Class\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nThe question of authenticity is more relevant to music than to any other art form. This is because in music the <i>representational</i> dimension of a work is invariably subservient to its <i>participatory</i> dimension. To enjoy music is not to study it abstractly but to be directly absorbed in its rhythms, to occupy with one\u2019s entire being the emotional life of the work, to identify oneself fully with its sentiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly it is possible and legitimate to understand, appreciate or criticize music that does not produce such an absorption. However, we can understand or appreciate it to the extent that we can understand or appreciate how such an absorption might be possible and we criticize it to the extent that we find such an absorption unthinkable or distasteful. We can talk about the authentication of musical experience much more than the authentication of looking at a painting or reading a book because the authentic enjoyment of music registers itself in concrete forms of physical participation\u2014in the form of unbroken rapt absorption or of a rhythmic tapping of the feet, of singing or of dancing, of knowing lyrics by heart or of only knowing some of them but still screaming along with every word. While this identification is sustained first and foremost by the force of the music itself, the importance of lyrics should not be underestimated. After all, the maximal authentication of a song consists not only in finding its tune catchy or its beat danceable, but finding its sentiments (as expressed by the vocal line) so true and perfectly expressed that one cannot help but follow along with them, feeling with every word the fullness of their meaning. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMusic\u2019s uniqueness in this regard might be questioned on two grounds: first, on the ground that full absorption is the necessary requirement for truly experiencing <i>any</i> work of art whatsoever, and, second, on the ground that with any work of art there are cultural conventions specifying the form that this absorption ought to take and that raise (as with music) the question of authenticity. However, the point here is not that such discourses of authenticity cannot be applied to other cultural practices, but rather that it is uniquely with regards to music we have a unified way of talking about authenticity, since our enjoyment of it is most verifiably felt within the human body. And while we can certainly talk about culturally inappropriate ways to <i>express</i> our authentic enjoyment of music (clapping after a solo during the symphony, for example), the <i>fact</i>of enjoyment remains absolute.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor the reasons above, I take the application of the concept of authenticity to musical enjoyment to be absolutely legitimate. However, it is clear that this concept of authenticity needs further elaboration. On what basis, after all, is the enjoyment of music sustained? On the one hand, there is something totally unmediated about our enjoyment of music\u2014we immediately feel our hearts beating with its rhythm. On the other hand, the enjoyment of particular music isn\u2019t simply an innate physical response since we all enjoy specific types of music, while other music leaves us cold, or even generates irritation or anxiety. Neither is it enough to attribute enjoyment to physiological habituation. Of course, on some purely physiological level, habituation is an adequate explanation for why people enjoy one kind of music rather than other. However, on a phenomenological level, this enjoyment can be interpreted in various specific ways: It can be Bacchic or Apollonian, heroic or melancholic, etc. And these phenomenological forms are what is actually significant about musical history, since they are expressions of what we take to be our specific ethical, political, and historical possibilities.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor this reason, the authentic enjoyment of music tends to find itself confronted with limits that are both spatial and temporal. Spatially, we are bound by culture, nationality and class. To speak of spatiality in these terms is highly metaphorical, but the metaphor is apt, since these differences constitute boundaries between various cultural worlds that are as real and difficult to bridge as anything physical. As Americans, we might identify with, say, a Chinese song that is nostalgic for China, but this identification cannot be taken literally. Our birth and upbringing outside of China forces us either to awkwardly project onto the song more familiar emotional reference points\u2014nostalgia for California, for example\u2014or else we might appreciate the song with an irony takes either the song\u2019s exoticism or else the symbolic resonances of \u201cChineseness\u201d to be the emotional content itself.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTemporally, our enjoyment is limited for two reasons: First because musical form is itself historically determined. For example, certain chords used to sound dissonant and contain certain resonances that we have become desensitized to. And second, because the affective content that these forms generate may be blocked by our incapacity to authentically feel various sentiments or embody various attitudes. In this case our appreciation will depend on the determinate way in which we aestheticize history\u2014in the resonances the aesthetic forms of the past take in the present moment. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe must also acknowledge, however, the deeply physical resonance of music and its capacity to transport the imagination into a different time or even into another body. This experience, as when a long-forgotten song may call up an entire world of latent memories, may be identified with the experience of Proust\u2019s madeleines. But it is also the experience of Herderian Einf\u00fchlung (\u201cfeeling in\u201d)\u2014the methodological basis of Herderian hermeneutics, whereby we are able to understand people of the past or of foreign cultures through a process of affective identification. It is for Herderian reasons, I suppose, that people speak of music as a universal language that bridges spatial as well as temporal distances. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEinf\u00fchlung takes a number of striking forms in the contemporary world, mostly notably the adoption of hip-hop attitudes by people of all races and classes\u2014a massive cultural movement that has ranged in its affect from utter earnestness to extreme irony. Of course, before hip-hop, there was the proliferation of various forms of roots music\u2014both white and black\u2014within the middle class. And indeed, pop music, as we know\u2014even in its most resolutely middle-class forms\u2014is based on the appropriation of lower-class or folk styles by the music industry. It is precisely in these cases that the question of authenticity has been most dramatically raised. Whether we like it or not, there is a real difference between, on the one hand, singing along with a song because it corresponds to one\u2019s actual life or to some fairly plausible racial or cultural identification (for example, someone who has a tractor singing along to \u201cShe Thinks My Tractor\u2019s Sexy\u201d), and, on the other hand, singing along vigorously to a song despite or even because of a much greater cultural or racial gap. To draw attention to this phenomenon is not to affirm the absolute status of racial and cultural distinctions but to raise the question of why such seemingly inauthentic identifications function so powerfully.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo be sure, a great deal of cultural innovation has been accomplished within the music industry itself, with its producers, technicians, established musicians, and tastemakers in a process that has combined the incorporation of \u201craw\u201d folk material, influences within the western art music tradition, and technological innovations that create new types of sound and new ways of mixing or altering recorded material. We might be tempted to call this ideal-typical technically and musically sophisticated product \u201cauthentically middle-class\u201d\u2014Steely Dan falls most famously into this category, insofar as their multilayered production and extreme perfectionism virtually efface the influences incorporated into their work as \u201craw material.\u201d However, it is also characteristic of middle-class discontent and self-loathing to find such \u201corganic\u201d middle class expressions \u201cinauthentic.\u201d This is an attitude that implicitly links the authentic with the poor or nonwhite. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe question therefore for middle-class music has been how to channel erotic and creative energies into some authentic form of creative expression. These energies, however, are not free-floating, as they might theoretically be in some future utopian society. This is because as long as there is poverty and class oppression in the world, the fact of poverty and oppression must be dealt with, accounted for, or repressed. In other words, the affect generated by music must account not only for what it expresses positively, but also for what it does not express, what it is incapable of expressing. To be sure, there are properly erotic drives that find expression in properly erotic songwriting, with its seemingly erotic (rather than political) forms of repression. However, as we shall see in our examination of David Bowie and the Smiths below, the more articulated an erotic stance is, the more its implicit politics become visible.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo within the middle-class musical tradition we find a wide array of responses to this problem, four of which I will address in the sections below. First there is a broadly universalist approach\u2014something like eastern spiritualism\u2014which attempts to subsume within a single cosmological vision all of the joy and suffering of the world. Second, there is an extreme individualism that finds through alienated personal affect a utopian transcendence of the world. Third, there is the evocation of a national or racial mythology, which both represses and underpins racial and class differences. And finally there is <i>Graceland</i>. The examples I have chosen are somewhat arbitrary and are not an exhaustive survey of middle-class music, especially in its more contemporary forms. However, they do express fundamentally divergent solutions to the political problems that determine the coordinates of musical expression.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>\r\n1. The King of Pain and The Road to Nowhere\r\n</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Police\u2019s album <i>Synchronicity</i> was written under the influence of Carl Jung\u2019s concept of \u201cSynchronicity,\u201d which posits the existence of metaphysical links between events in discontinuous regions of the space-time continuum. As such the album\u2019s subject matter ranges across a vast number of epochs and locations from the age of the dinosaurs (\u201cWalking in Your Footsteps\u201d) to the fictional world of a Paul Bowles novel (\u201cTea in the Sahara\u201d) to Soviet Russia (\u201cMiss Gradenko\u201d). And within specific songs there is a connection made between seemingly disparate phenomena\u2014\u201canother industrial ugly morning\u201d and the Loch Ness Monster emerging from a Scottish lake; and the King of Pain, who, like some Hindu god, exists in a number of avatars: the little black spot on the sun, the butterfly caught in a spider\u2019s web, Oedipus Rex (a king on the throne with his eye\u2019s torn out), and a variety of other phenomena of all shapes and sizes. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Synchronicity</i> is remarkably successful at evoking the vastness and multifactedness of the world. The irony of such an album is that as it ages, its reflexive temporal universality is increasingly belied by the datedness of its musical style. While <i>Synchronicity</i> remains a good album, it is marked both by a New Age-y concept of the universal, inspired by drugs and Eastern mysticism, and by the unabated use of primitive synthesizers. Can we attribute this problem to a problem with temporal universality itself\u2014i.e. is it a reproach to Eastern mysticism?\u2014or is it merely indicative of the difficulty of representing mysticism in popular music? Must it necessarily take more primitive forms that forego any attempts at representation? Or is representation the only means that mysticism has of getting a handle on the complexity of the modern world?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Flaming Lips\u2019 \u201cYoshimi Battles the Pink Robots\u201d has a similarly Jungian mystical approach that is mediated by futuristic video-game imagery. The premise of the album is the reemergence of primitive archetypes (specifically, the battle between good and evil) on some new dematerialized plane\u2014the titular battle could take place in the future, in a video game, or in the imagination. \u201cDo you realize,\u201d we are asked, \u201cyou have the most beautiful face? Do you realize . . . you are floating in space? Do you realize, someday, everyone you know will die?\u201d This is not a fantasy world (it is our world insofar as these propositions hold true) but it is deprived of the spatial and temporal coordinates that we are familiar with, since the stakes of Yoshimi\u2019s battle with the \u201cevil robots\u201d (unlike the stakes of Neo\u2019s battle against the robots of the Matrix\u2014avatars of soulless capitalist parasitism) are unelaborated.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat the Police and the Flaming Lips have in common in these two examples is a representational strategy that denies the importance of perspective in narrative. Perspective has two valences\u2014it concerns first of all the positioning of an individual subject in space and time that makes possible determinate political or ethical commitments; second, it concerns a <i>higher</i> position that immediate problems or interests in terms of a more absolute measure of importance. Carl Schmitt\u2019s <i>The Concept of the Political</i> illustrates the tension between these two senses. Schmitt polemicizes against the universalization of politics (in for example, the discourse of \u201chuman rights\u201d or \u201cinternational norms\u201d), insofar as this universalization denies the true basis of politics in the self-preservation of a people and its way of life against external forces that threaten to destroy it. So for Schmitt, there is an inherent limit to how high a perspective one can take, since even a humanistic liberal world order finds itself posed against internal forces that threaten its existence and which must therefore be ceaselessly sought out and extirpated in the name of a fake universalism.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe basic appeal made by both the Police and the Flaming Lips is to an elimination of the self\u2014that is to say a abandonment of a narrower personal perspective in favor of an entry into a cosmic stream of consciousness, in which we may be reincarnated in any place or time\u2014 either as a Japanese robot-fighter of the future or as a prehistoric dinosaur.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis same stream is evoked in a much more temporal context by the Talking Heads in \u201cOnce in a Lifetime\u201d as \u201cthe water flowing underground\u201d and also in \u201cRoad to Nowhere\u201d as the Road to Nowhere itself. At the moments in which we have awareness of our subjective and somatic particularity it appears in an alien and uncanny form\u2014\u201cWhat is this beautiful house? Who is this beautiful wife? Where does this highway lead to?\u201d The stream/highway metaphor of the lyrics is a perfect description of the musical propulsiveness of these two songs. However, this metaphor and musical form also makes us suspect that all of these universalisms are not so much attempts to rework a lost mysticism in terms of modern content, but rather reflections of the pace of modern life itself, and that the renunciation of the self might turn out ultimately to be a resignation of political agency in an autonomized material world, to which human subjects seem increasingly to be mere appendages.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHere the much more general question is raised whether the historical condition of postmodernity initiates us into some new age of liberated cosmic consciousness, or whether it is instead merely a new stage of capitalism.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>\r\n2. Sinking in the Quicksand\r\n</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nParadoxically, David Bowie\u2019s work, despite his futuristic spaceman persona, is diametrically opposed to the aforementioned cases, since he is not interested in archetypes or temporal universals but in the New, the Homo Superior, the rock star, whose fetishized body (Ziggy Stardust\u2019s \u201cgod-given ass,\u201d for example) serves as eucharist for the society of the spectacle. Yet many of his lyrics are filled with the sort of British vernacular we find in The Kinks\u2019 <i>Village Green Preservation Society</i> or the Beatles\u2019 \u201cPenny Lane.\u201d In this aesthetic, most prominent on \u201cLife on Mars?\u201d the British \u201cgirl with the mousy hair\u201d is \u201chooked to the silver screen\u201d\u2014to the repetitive but magnetic cliches of the American culture industry. She is bored, isolated, has forsaken her family. But unlike the daughter of the Beatles\u2019 \u201cShe\u2019s Leaving Home,\u201d Bowie\u2019s protagonist has not been seduced by a young man and dreams of leaving home, but instead by a much more violent rejection of material reality, that sees the world of the present as nothing but repetition, a world of cavemen in which life has no worth except as a boring spectacle or freak-show. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWalter Benjamin characterized fascism as the aestheticization of the political, and in many ways Bowie\u2019s work is an introjection of this process, an attempt to relocate the forces of creative destruction within the subject itself. Instead of attempting a harmonious unity with the external world, Bowie\u2019s music affirms the most geologically disruptive forces within the present moment, seeing in these forces a redemption from the banality of the modern age. Yet these songs also raise the doubt as to whether these violent subjective impulses have any truly transformative power, or whether they are \u201ctethered to the logic of Homo Sapien,\u201d condemned to \u201csink into the quicksand.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA more concrete form of this fantasy can be found in the music of the Smiths which in some ways is more powerful than Bowie\u2019s because it derives its imagery from a more collective working class experience and its emotional impulse from a sense of isolation and desire for a collective form of fulfillment. The ambiguity with which Morissey deals with homosexuality  (\u201cyou\u2019re a girl and I\u2019m a boy/ I\u2019m a girl and you\u2019re a boy,\u201d \u201cif there\u2019s something you\u2019d like to try, ask me, I won\u2019t say no, how could I?\u201d) allows it to stand in for an infinite variety of repressed and thwarted erotic impulses. And Morissey\u2019s lyrics attack the oppressiveness not only of social mores, but of wage labor itself, which \u201cpays my way and corrodes my soul.\u201d Morissey\u2019s objectives\u2014artistic creation, the pursuit of celebrity and sexual fulfillment\u2014are not posed as stations in man\u2019s evolution to a higher post-human form, but rather components of a new lifestyle, a space of autonomy and happiness that is seized or demanded as if it is a human right: \u201cI am human and I need to be loved. . . just like everybody else does.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHere, the question of the authenticity arises with regard to the status that we grant individual subjective pathos. For on the one hand, it reacts to a condition\u2014the banalization of mass culture and the tediousness and humiliation of wage labor\u2014which is undeniably dismal, but on the other hand it magnifies individual emotional suffering to grotesque proportions, in what Jameson, following Sartre, describes as \u201can inner, psychological identification between self-justification and special [class] privileges.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>\r\n3. Dixie\r\n</h3>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn contrast to this British individualism, the genre known as Americana affirms pathos insofar as it is experienced collectively, not simply with Americans of today, but as part of a continuous tradition extending back to the Civil War or farther. Thus we have songs like the Band\u2019s \u201cThe Night they Drove Old Dixie Down\u201d, and \u201cKing Harvest,\u201d Bob Dylan\u2019s (fictional) \u201cJohn Wesley Harding,\u201d and Neil Young\u2019s \u201cPowderfinger\u201d and \u201cPocahontas,\u201d which dredge up the racial and class violence of the past as raw material for some new mythology. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nParticularly interesting in this context is the tragic image projected onto the South, which we see reemerging over and over again, for example in the Silver Jews\u2019 \u201cRebel Jew\u201d: \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nSometimes I dream of Texas<br />\r\nYeah, it\u2019s the biggest part of me<br />\r\nAnd the plains look like the sea at night<br />\r\nOh, she wants to be so free<br />\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nShe is a rebel state<br />\r\nShe is a rebel state<br />\r\nAnd it\u2019s not too late for her to break<br />\r\nFrom a sick sick union<br />\r\nAn unhealed wound and separate. . . <br />\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are a number of transgressive elements of this song\u2014first the characterization of Jesus as a \u201crebel Jew,\u201d but second, and more importantly, the glorification of the South\u2019s fight for independence, which goes much farther than the maudlin sentimentality we see in \u201cThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.\u201d Though it may be wrong to claim that the Civil War was \u201conly about slavery,\u201d it is unquestionably significant, given the powerful association of the biblical slavery of the Jews in Egypt with the slavery of blacks in the United States, that David Berman is so drawn to the mythology of the slaveholding South.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI would even argue that these sorts of identifications are a way of absorbing contemporary racial and class divisions, since\u2014so the logic goes\u2014if one has been oppressed in the past one cannot possibly be an oppressor in the present. This logic lies at the heart of Americana, and consequently, the question of authenticity ceaselessly poses itself like a return of the repressed\u2014that is to say, America\u2019s repressed history of racial and class violence and the persistence of inequality in the present.\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n4. Graceland\r\n</h3>\r\nWithin this tradition, Paul Simon occupies an especially interesting position. Consider first, the wonderful opening scene of the Coen Brothers\u2019 <i>Intolerable Cruelty</i>, in which the Geoffrey Rush character drives home in his sports car singing along to Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s \u201cThe Boxer\u201d (\u201cI am just a poor boy, though my story\u2019s seldom told,\u201d the song begins) only to find his wife in bed with the pool cleaner. Paul Simon, like Bob Dylan and David Berman, is Jewish-American, and as such comes from an immigrant population mostly assimilated into the white middle class. While the secret of Dylan\u2019s coolness was his complete disavowal of these roots (Berman on the other hand, accepts them ironically, while simultaneously adopting wholesale the Americana aesthetic), Simon never conceals them. His work pioneered a distinctively middle class sentimental realism in songwriting that finds few parallels in the music of his time. His songs lack the utopian experimentalism of the Beatles or the hard-edged sexual aggression of the Rolling Stones, but focus instead on the search for America, the isolation of living in the city, etc. This inability to transcend a middle-class sensibility is both Simon\u2019s weakness as a songwriter (in contrast to Dylan\u2019s uncanny ventriloquism of the working class), but also what makes his best work so good, in particular 1986\u2019s <i>Graceland</i>.\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\nAs an album, <i>Graceland</i> is a strange mixture: a few songs are more purely Americana (for example, \u201cThat Was Your Mother,\u201d which was recorded with zydeco musicians). But the most interesting tracks on <i>Graceland</i> are recorded with South African musicians and attempt to reimagine the place of America and the American middle class in terms of much larger dimensions of experience. \r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n\u201cDiamonds on the Soles of her Shoes\u201d plays on an initial uncertainty about the location of the song. At first it seems as if we might be dealing with a poor African boy and a rich African girl\u2014living in a world sheltered from the West, where diamonds signify a type of wealth that can\u2019t be judged by American standards for the precise reason that diamonds come from Africa\u2014within this context they are a local luxury. However, as the song plays out, we realize that it is \u201creally\u201d about two Americans\u2014the scale of wealth we are dealing with is both larger but also less metaphorical, since Africa as an object of representation can, in the context of an American pop album, only be a shadowy mirror to a more vivid America of \u201cthe bodegas and the lights on upper Broadway.\u201d\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\nSimilarly \u201cYou can Call me Al\u201d vacillates between a properly Western perspective\u2014the midlife crisis, a type of existential desperation springing from a life of material abundance (\u201csoft in the middle\u201d is the term Simon here uses to describe himself)\u2014and another more foreign and violent \u201cthird world\u201d of \u201ccattle in the marketplace\u201d where people exchange physical protection (\u201cyou can be my bodyguard\u201d) for a pretense of friendship. Note that the offer is not to \u201cbe your pal,\u201d but to \u201cbe your long lost pal.\u201d So not only is this an exchange, but a tacit pact of deception. Again, we\u2019ve exchanged Simon\u2019s more properly American imagery and pathos for something implicitly foreign. \r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n\u201cGraceland\u201d similarly employs a typically American narrative paradigm\u2014the road. We have as predecessors the Thunder Road of Bruce Springsteen, but also the Road to Nowhere of the Talking Heads and the road of Paul Simon\u2019s own \u201cAmerica\u201d\u2014though in this case, the pilgrimage is not to New York City, but to Graceland, the cradle of the Civil War\u2014a quest not for America as melting pot, but for an American essence that is eminently ethnic in nature and evokes the deep racial divisions within American history, from the Civil War itself to the charge, however seriously we take it, that Elvis stole rock and roll from black musicians. When Simon sings that \u201cfor reasons I cannot explain / There's some part of me wants to see Graceland,\u201d his uncertainty expresses precisely the ambivalent nature of Americana discussed above, in particular  a discomfort with and unwillingness to face up to the origins of the southern fantasy.\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\nFor all this, and even because of all this, Graceland is a mecca, a place where, the narrator has \u201creason to believe, we all will be received,\u201d with the Christian Grace that is implicit in the place\u2019s name. The song is folksy Americana, but also employs many of the same African rhythms and stylistic flourishes that appear on the rest of the album. And what makes the appeal of Graceland so ecumenical is that a pilgrimage must be made to get there\u2014that the neither the Jewish-American singer nor the South-African musicians have roots in \u201cthe cradle of the Civil War.\u201d Though Graceland is iconically American it is also a bit alien, and in invoking it, Paul Simon might as well be invoking the \u201cweird America\u201d of the Basement Tapes. So his pilgrimage to America must drag along with it all sorts of other musical influences that are not properly American, as if it is only through this process that the feeling of dynamism inherent to the American myth of the road can be reconstituted, as if the true dimensions of America and the American road experience could only be invoked by an appeal to more distant cultural reference points, as if the drive to Graceland would lead us all the way to Africa or further.\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\nAnd in fact the American road trip of \u201cGraceland\u201d is the most limited form of spatialization attempted on the album. \u201cYou Can Call Me Al,\u201d \u201cDiamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,\u201d and \u201cUnder African Skies\u201d evoke even more strongly a transatlantic and even global dimension. In \u201cThe Boy in the Bubble\u201d the reference points go into orbit, as \u201cstaccato signals of constant information, a loose affiliation of millionaires and billionaires,\u201d and into outer space when Simon sings of \u201ca distant constellation that is dying in the corner of the sky.\u201d The song \u201cGraceland\u201d with its appeal to the metaphor of the road, is subsumed from the opening salvo of \u201cThe Boy in the Bubble\u201d into a much more complex global vision: \u201cIt was a hot day and the sun was beating on the soldiers at the side of the road. There was a bright light, a shattering of shop windows, the bomb in the baby carriage was wired to a radio.\u201d In terms of the breadth of its imagery and spiritual dimensions, this song has a great deal in common with the Police\u2019s <i>Synchronicity</i>, but unlike <i>Synchronicity</i>, the links that bind our world into a whole are technological and historical. Only with Simon\u2019s evocation of the distant constellation (echoes of Benjamin?) does our own fate as a species find a spiritual, inhuman counterpart (political theology?).\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\nThe world Simon portrays in this song is both utopian and dystopian\u2014both apocalyptic and messianic. \u201cThese are the days of miracles and wonder,\u201d he sings. \u201cAnd don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry.\u201d Is this meant as a genuine sign of hope, or as an act of comfort mitigating a fear that the progress of history and technology has finally surpassed the power of human agency over our collective destiny?\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<i>Graceland</i>, by treating our own \u201cfirst world\u201d experience as a strange foreign object, avoids the simple trap of liberal guilt or narcissism. Yet we cannot simply treat the music\u2019s perspective as African, since the singer-songwriter all along is the confused but earnest Paul Simon, navigating the materialistic world of Manhattan but also looking outside\u2014to both Graceland and South Africa\u2014for answers.\r\n<p>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>And we must necessarily wonder if <i>Graceland</i> could mean the same thing twenty five years later, now that \u201cworld music\u201d has been fully incorporated into the culture industry\u2014now that the \u201cstaccato signals\u201d virtually emanate from our bodies.<img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

Do you know the slogan? Boredom is <i>always</i> counter-revolutionary. Graffiti from Mai '68. Before that, a proposition of the journal <i>Internationale Situationniste</i> (1962; also 1959 according to Raoul Vaneigem's <i>Trait\u00e9 de Savoir-vivre</i>). Every single part of this slogan is awkward today. Certainly, after a century of the infidelity of the <i>avant-garde,</i> leftists are trying to instill duller virtues in the young bourgeoisie, in hopes that its fervor might finally become reliable. <a href=\"http://www.versobooks.com/blogs/736\">Fall in love with hard work.</a> For these, its Marxist partisans, boredom has been revindicated by a critique of bourgeois self-spectacularization (which is ironic, since this term was itself a Situationist contribution), that is, still from the point of view of the revolutionary and the counter-revolutionary. This first defense of boredom has joined forces with a second, which it obscures: that, even as a metaphor, revolution has no monopoly on the history of feminist, gay, genderqueer resistance and invention. New solidarities, new familiarities, new estrangements, new ethics, new asceticisms\u2026 Creativity is the calendar of such resistance, and the question of its source achieves new practical and philosophical interest. What's remarkable is that, in this context, boredom has been affirmed <i>as a source of invention.</i> The microscopic, the private, the banal, and the apolitical have proven unexpectedly fertile.\r\n</p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n<p>\r\nA slogan which is, despite its awkwardness, so contemporary: it is not just an evaluation of boredom on the basis of revolutionary politics. It is already the introduction into politics of affect. The predicate, \"counter-revolutionary,\" no longer means what it did before. Such a d\u00e9tournement is justified by the fact that revolution, by '68, <i>was boring:</i> \u201cParty of reds, party of greys / our revolutions are betrayed.\u201d The problem wasn't that revolution wasn't big or dramatic enough. Something else was demanded.\r\n</p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n<p>Boredom was privileged because of its special relationship to wage labor. Another beautiful slogan: \u201cLive without dead time.\u201d This critique mobilized a heritage even more surrealist than Freudian. At its heart was the idea that wage-labor killed in you the ability to create, the ability to make poetry. It featured a typically surrealist identification of such creativity with desire as such; unlike the Freudian critique of work which identifies work and art as sublimation, which, in both cases, represses and recuperates the drives. So sometimes the slogan was extended: \u201cLive without dead time / enjoy without inhibition.\u201d A critique of dead time meant simultaneously a determination of \u201cliving\u201d as desiring, creating, and enjoying. That is, politics would be desire's programme. This is not a completely new idea; indeed, already with Sade's famous treatise framed by <i>Philosophy in the Bedroom,</i> liberty is determined as the self-annihilating submission to desire's nightmarish imperatives: \u201cFran\u00e7ais, encore un effort si vous voulez \u00eatre r\u00e9publicains!\u201d In some ways, everywhere in the '60s politics was desire's program; that's why we credit Mai '68 with a \u201ccultural revolution,\u201d as consolation prize. But what would be desire's program? Today it does not resemble that of the '60s and '70s. Lauren Berlant asks about the \u201ccelibacy epidemic\u201d\u2014the loss of interest, among otherwise radical young people, in sex and sexual liberation (<a href=\"http://publichumanities.english.pdx.edu/Downloads/Workshops/LaurenBerlant/BerlantStarved.pdf\">\u201cStarved\u201d</a>). Is it because a radical and stimulating liberal arts \u201ctheory\u201d curriculum has, ironically, consolidated attachment to rational/critical subjectivity, without being able to instill a taste or toleration for loss of control? Because \u201cthere is no emotional habitus for being queer and building a world for it\u201d? Perhaps because, in this respect, the easy work has already been accomplished, the taboos have been lifted wherever the infrastructure for such world-building could be easily borrowed from existing institutions\u2014so now we have, outside of marriage, a very similar institution. The distinction between desire's programme and what Berlant remembers or proposes as, simply, \u201csex,\u201d remains a theoretical tangent to this discussion. But the concepts of sex and desire have in common a certain affinity to the surrealist kind of liberty, a certain fullness of life, a certain vitalism of the unconscious, and, relatedly, a certain danger. They also have in common their lack of privilege in contemporary political projects. \u201cEnjoy without inhibition\u201d isn't on anybody's picket sign.\r\n</p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n<p>At the end his 1967 <i>Treatise on Savoir-Vivre for the Use of Young Generations,</i> Vaneigem explicates the 1962 thesis, \u201cBoredom is always counter-revolutionary.\u201d He contrasts boredom to \u201c[love's] intensity, its here-and-nowness, its physical exaltation, its emotional fluidity, its eager acceptance of precariousness, of change: everything indicates that love will prove the key factor in recreating the world.\u201d Such praise of resilience in emotional fluidity, such injunction to \u201ceagerly accept precariousness,\u201d would raise eyebrows in 2009-2011. But the paradox of Occupation is how exposed, precarious, and anarchic it is. The occupiers are resilient, and do possess\u2014in stark contrast to the young generation's \u201cepidemic celibacy\u201d\u2014the courage of formlessness. This contradiction is, in part, native to a modal tension around austerity, that is, a dispute over its necessity. Austerity measures are justified as \u201cnecessary,\u201d \u201cunavoidable.\u201d Unrealistic levels of comfort for certain industries, certain countries, <i>naturally</i> cannot be sustained. All leftists should oppose this rhetoric; it is usually bullshit. But like many lies, it draws its plausibility from something universally felt to be true, so that, although protestors deny the necessity of austerity, they also prepare themselves for it. It is this briskness, with which a generation is already adapting to austerity, that forebodes. But the paradox has a second sense. If austerity is opposed, this is no longer in the name of the old alternatives\u2014the \u201cgood life\u201d as promised in America up till now: 40-hour workweek, TV, family, car, weekend, vacation\u2014that have become both impossible and unappealing. Something else is demanded. The young opposition to austerity is, therefore, \u201cavant-garde.\u201d So is the formlessness of occupant life, which combines precarity and care, testing a third way between the stale old \u201cgood life\u201d and the cold new freedoms.\r\n</p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n<p>Sadness, like boredom, articulates onto time and work. Here we enter into the curious polyrhythms of unemployment that characterize the Occupation in its diversity. Great numbers of involuntarily unemployed present at the Occupations have never had a choice outside life-draining work and poverty. But many are on a different cycle; especially because the movement is predominantly urban, and, depending greatly on the city, many of the participants are young people who have not only never been habituated to 40-hour work weeks, but have in fact been offered a kind of bargain that responds in its way to the Situationist critique of the conditions of labor, granting to a select few a different arrangement: freedom, rawness, employment only according to initiative and invention. The life of the freelancer. Comfortable precarity, whether supported by lucky sectors like tech and tutoring or by family provision, has even been extremely productive and successful. At the same time it is very conducive to depression. Generally the two responses to this depression follow the paradigms of the talking cure or of ergotherapy, depending, inter alia, on how discursively disposed the kid is. In some respects the Occupy movement gathers force from the possibility of experimenting with a different kind of activity, neither work nor talk; something might be learned about depression; a kind of community that works might be discovered.\r\n</p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n<p>In contrast to a general strike, which is a pause in work, the Occupation is overwhelmingly a pause in the absence of work. What this pause means is different according to the particular type of unoccupation, or better, disoccupation, interrupted. But the pun from occupation to \u201ckeeping yourself occupied\u201d is not at all misleading; nor the double-sense of \u201coccupation\u201d as activity in general and as burgeoning movement. If it is unclear what kind of activity is found in the Occupation, whether it will someday be remembered by the name \u201cwork\u201d or by some other name or not by a name, it is clear that what is occupied is lost time, unused bodies; or, in the case of those who leave off their freelance industriousness to join, used bodies and used time are reoccupied, and perhaps something is given that was missing. But the nature of this lostness of time, the sense of this unhappiness, and the fantasies born in Occupy have not yet consolidated. They can still be provoked, and they cannot yet be inventoried.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\">\r\n<br><br>\r\n<h3>Coda on a Kind of Sex</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nAbove we noted what follows \u201cLive without dead time\u201d: \u201cEnjoy without inhibition.\u201d Vaneigem's <i>Treatise</i> proposes a similar opposition: against ennui are love, desire, and pleasure, all mixed-together. The \u201cmodel\u201d of all three, in these pages, is the couple. The couple's privilege follows from Vaneigem's erotic ideal of \u201cutter transparency,\u201d of \u201cthe orgasm [as] the total fusion of two separate beings.\u201d The couple is \u201cclearly the simplest model of the erotic\u2026 Two people live their experiences as transparently and as freely as possible. This radiant complicity has all the charm of incest. Their wealth of common experiences can only lead to a brother-and-sister relationship.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHumor the following thought experiment. We are going to ask some questions to Vaneigem, but we are going to imagine that desire, or \u201csex,\u201d is at the heart of our political moment, that it is live, that it is tall red graffiti in our cities. We will have to ask: To what extent does union remain desire's programme? Must union remain union <i>with someone?</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe will recall other couplings, some some of which Vaneigem (polemically) excludes\u2014father-child, mother-child\u2014and others still out of mind\u2014pupil and teacher, master and slave\u2014all  opposed by fraternal parity for political reasons. Could we expect politics to propose new relations as well?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWe will observe the absence here of roles and their reversal; whereas fiction and invention, theater and <i>mise en sc\u00e8ne,</i> quotation and irony, serve eroticism everywhere! So, how far can union outpace transparency?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt is claimed, perhaps prematurely, that a new \u201cerotic potentiality\u201d has emerged at the Occupation. Not the absolute transparency of voice, but the murky, enjambed refrain of the pack of what <a href=\"http://hypocritereader.com/10/appendix-microphone\">Adam Weg calls</a> \u201creaders\u201d at the people's microphone. But where sex is concerned, the premature is the byproduct of anticipation.\r\n</p>\r\n",

It\u2019s a good thing my parents help out with rent. At least my job lets me travel. People will pay sixty dollars on Etsy for clothes I find at Goodwill. I can always donate my eggs. Last time she donated her eggs the hormones she was injecting into her butt cheek made her produce 25 eggs at once. Sex work through <a href = www.eros.com>eros.com</a> pays four hundred dollars per hour. It\u2019s good to have regular clients. Sometimes they pay me just so they can eat me out for an hour. LSAT tutoring pays a hundred and twenty five dollars for two hours. I can make websites from anywhere in the world. I\u2019m in credit card debt but I\u2019m betting the monetary system is going to collapse soon anyway, when my credit gets high enough I\u2019m gonna buy a $3000 bike from REI and tour the country and disappear. I have $16,000 in student loans. In five years I\u2019ll have my master plumbing certificate and then I can make thirty dollars an hour. I\u2019ve started selling weed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOn a good day I can make fifty dollars in tips. I\u2019m thinking about getting a yoga teaching certificate. My friend invited me out to California to trim weed. I meant to work on my resume today. I\u2019m thinking of applying to graduate school. I\u2019ve heard they want more minorities to apply. I\u2019m thinking of going back to college. I want to get a job so I\u2019m not just bleeding money. If I had two hundred dollars I know exactly what I\u2019d do with it. The only other person I\u2019ve told this to is my therapist but my mother gives me forty dollars for my meds every week but lately I\u2019ve been pocketing the money.

It\u2019s called \u201cHeartbreak Hotel.\u201d It\u2019s been my \u201cother room,\u201d a place to squander some time and some words and do the embarrassing thing, the queer thing, except it\u2019s not embarrassing it\u2019s just what you do and it\u2019s pleasurable, when you turn off the thing that tells you it\u2019s embarrassing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am trying to imagine myself <a href =http://www.theawl.com/2011/02/being-female> being loved </a>. I am learning this, most recently from Eileen Myles. \r\n<blockquote>\r\n\u201cI try and act like it\u2019s mine. The culture. That I\u2019m its beloved son. It\u2019s not an impossible conceit. But it\u2019s hard. Because a woman, reflexively, often feels unloved.\u201d \r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n(Although it feels weird that she doesn\u2019t at least give the nod to trans/queer/ethnic/lower class/marginalized groups in general, those who don\u2019t even get pie charts.) I see these comfortable, slow talkers at the General Assembly and they have wisdom and they\u2019re older and they\u2019re white men, and they\u2019re probably used to people listening to their wisdom. Almost all of the girls or queers I admire speak in short snappy sentences. They\u2019re good at inflection. They\u2019re good at the sales pitch. The well-timed comment. But if it\u2019s boring and it\u2019s coming out of an Asian girl\u2019s mouth then she\u2019s just a <a href = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_paPPxws-U >boring</a> <a href = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQflpKcQXOM >Asian</a> <a href= http://youtu.be/tEvRvgHqarg> girl</a>. Some of that mindset had entered my pen.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnyways, on October 23rd at the Goodwill Electronics store in Lincoln I found a robin\u2019s-egg-blue Smith Corona for three dollars.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat day I misplaced my journal and thought I might have lost it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThat night I got stoned and I was frustrated with myself for not writing. So I typed a manifesto called THE WRITE   WRITE JUST    FUCKING WRITE MANIFESTO. \u201cIt is important to get out of the habit of checking to see if what you\u2019re doing is proper and valid before doing it,\u201d I wrote. \u201cExuberance is not incompatible with care and beauty. Slowness and sadness are not incompatible with diligence. If you have never seen anything like what you are writing don\u2019t be scared be excited. If you feel like you\u2019ve seen what you are writing 1,000 times don\u2019t hate yourself get pumped. You are in an arena you know,\u201d I wrote. \u201cIt is important to have concrete goals rather than abstract ones such as \u2018being loved\u2019\u2026 Your need for other people will have to sort itself out.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIt was late at night, and I was feeling that queer freedom that sometimes comes late at night, when you feel like you\u2019re living in \u201cextra\u201d time that you can do whatever you want with. And there was this phrase, \u201cHeartbreak Hotel,\u201d which had appeared already twice in my typewriting that day, though I do not know where it came from. I wanted to write.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo I started a new page and typed, \u201cHeartbreak Hotel, day 1.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.8em; \">\r\nHEARTBREAK HOTEL, day 1\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nI am not going to decide in advance if this is a journal entry or essay or poem or what.\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nIn the beginning you had a beaky laughy face.\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\n[. . .]\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nDo I still sometimes look good to you?\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nI who have never been brave enough to be cheesy or sentimental\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\n\t\t\t\tI WHO SPENT ALL MY TIME\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\n\t\tWorrying whether I was being cheesy or sentimental without\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\n\t\tKnowing it.

The feeling of it being only \u201cday 1\u201d excited me, in addition to the feeling of being in an uncharted writing space. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe next morning, waking up alone, in a strange city in which I have no history, I still wanted to write. I wanted to write a world in which my writing couldn\u2019t be in bad taste and where there was no wrong way for me to relate to my feelings. I wanted to write a world in which I could write.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.8em;\">\r\n\r\nHEARTBREAK HOTEL, day 2<br>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\n\u201cWhen are you gonna come out of there, girl?\u201d\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\n[. . .]\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nHEARTBREAK HOTEL is about someone saying \u201cand after he said that, Debbie pointed out\u2014rightly, I might add\u2014\u2026\u201d\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nHEARTBREAK HOTEL is about wanting to want your own space.\r\n<p align = center>\r\n\t\t\t\t\ti want to want my own space forever.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n[. . .]\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\ni am writing out of you right now HEARTBREAK HOTEL whatever you are. <br.\r\ni lost my journal but maybe i\u2019ll get it back.<br>\r\n<p>\r\n[. . .]\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nHEARTBREAK HOTEL is where I go when love is the worry worrying at the gnawing (when that is all it is) and I say ENOUGH.

I was learning that on the page you can do whatever you want. You can write yourself or rewrite yourself or unwrite yourself, for as long as you want and for as long as you feel safe. In the same way that a hotel is a liminal space between the domestic and the new, the accepting home and the critical public, Heartbreak Hotel was becoming for me a liminal space between journal and world. Because in a journal, in my journal at least, the bargain was that in return for it being a home space that no one would ever see, I could write what I want. But then it started being a boring space. Heartbreak Hotel still had the feeling of a stage, a proscenium where I could enact my own reality for an audience that was TBA. \r\n<p>\r\n\r\nI took time to describe the Heartbreak Hotel from inside and from the outside. On the inside it has \u201csoundproof walls, of course, to keep in the typewriting sounds.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.8em; \">\r\n<p>\r\n[. . .]\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nthe HEARTBREAK HOTEL is everything you could want in a home but it doesn\u2019t feel lived-in, it will never feel lived-in in the sense of having pictures taped to the refrigerator wall you don\u2019t even remember taping there.\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\na teleporter for your therapist to come visit you in your room\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nsome good porn?\r\n<p>\r\n[. . .]\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\na map showing the whereabouts of your heartache at all times so you can know without having to ask\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\na clarity potion so you can feel clear when you want &<br>\r\na confusion potion so you can feel like you have a healthy dose of reality\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOn the evening of day 2 in the Heartbreak Hotel I felt anxious and sad because I had thought for a while that my Love Narrative might resume but then it never arrived. (Later it did arrive but not quite as a Love Narrative and we went dumpster diving.) I spent a paragraph typing \u201cthis is nothing.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI felt like I\u2019d \u201cbetrayed\u201d the Heartbreak Hotel because I wanted out, I wanted to be free to choose my Love Narrative again. \r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.8em; \">\r\nHEARTBREAK HOTEL, evening of day 2\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n[. . .]\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now I think I am not in Heartbreak Hotel because right now I just want everything to be O.K. I am wanting the one thing that you are not allowed to want in Heartbreak Hotel: To bring the freedom inside these walls out into the world. To choose Heartbreak Hotel is to choose freedom over the possibility of fullness.\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nThe good thing about Heartbreak Hotel, though, is that it\u2019s open 24/7/365. You can always come back so long as you are willing to travel the way. Like many places, it can look both more alluring and more desolate from a distance. From a distance it can look like an impossible lifestyle decision.\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nTime to check out the real world, then.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nSince I was no longer in the Heartbreak Hotel, I wrote from The World.\r\n<p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.8em; \">\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD, day 1\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nI spent today in the world rather than in Heartbreak Hotel. I am still processing what that means for Heartbreak Hotel. I am pretty sure it will still stay open and in business, patronized by a queer brand of formerly-open person who has decided to close for a little while.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\n\r\n[. . .]\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nHere are some things THE WORLD has that HEARTBREAK HOTEL lacks:\r\nParks, trees, e.g. outdoors stuff, advice, good advice, bad advice, opinions, weather, chance, publicity, kisses, well you know what I mean you can have kisses in Heartbreak Hotel but they are gray and unsatisfying, moments when your mood doesn\u2019t matter, when the world is your mood (in HH your mood is your world), a feeling of decisions coming easily. THE WORLD is impossible to describe fully like any world but more so.\r\n<p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\n\r\nHow will I continue my writing project if I keep extending my sojourn out here?\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nI believe that I still live in Heartbreak Hotel though. I am going to camp outside for a while, that\u2019s all. And I will describe the view from outside.\r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlready here I see myself thinking of the Heartbreak Hotel not just as a head space or a fantasy space but as a writing project, still a new, delicate, sensitive topic for me. Me: an institution-bound, parent-pleasing girl who has had little experience with assigning herself projects. The rhythm of days, the journalistic feel, the liminality of it helped me to live in/with it. I knew how to write and I had been journaling forever. I was also stimulated by the creative reflexivity of it, the feeling that I was constructing the Heartbreak Hotel as I wrote, free to change the project as I worked on it without it totally collapsing into formlessness.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nDid the specter of the occupation, this feeling of camping in a new, self-determining space while your old space remained, influence my way of thinking about the world versus the Heartbreak Hotel?\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote style=\"font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; font-weight: bold; font-size: 0.8em; \">\r\nHEARTBREAK HOTEL, the view from outside\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nThe word that comes to mind is \u201cimposing.\u201d It seems kind of sterile. It seems like a place where distractions don\u2019t really distract. In Heartbreak Hotel nothing distracts, everything is wonderful or terrible or there, just like everything else, neither more nor less than everything else.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nIt seems a little bit like, why would you live there unless you \u201chad\u201d to.\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nIt also seems well-defended and cozy.<br>\r\nYou might be wondering how to get to Heartbreak Hotel.\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nWell I\u2019m not entirely sure how I found it myself; it certainly wasn\u2019t on any maps that anyone ever gave me. I mean I knew about Heartbreak but I didn\u2019t know that there was a secret place inside of Heartbreak which (for a price, of course) could give you space. From the inside it seems like space from THE WORLD but from the outside it seems like maybe it just gives you space from insecurity. Which is correct, the inside view or the outside view? It has to be both.\r\n<p>\r\n[. . .]\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nTHINGS THAT THE HEARTBREAK HOTEL HAS THAT THE WORLD DOESN\u2019T HAVE:\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nAll of the things that your shrunken desire desires, space or perhaps what is more, a fixed amount of space, rather than the constantly fluctuating amount of space that THE WORLD gives you, all the attendant things of space\u2014permissiveness, freedom\u2014lots of mirrors, \u201cenclave,\u201d\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 20px; text-indent: -20px;\">\r\nWhat\u2019s comforting is that the Heartbreak Hotel promises to never promise that it can be a home, while being there to house you for as long as you can find it, afford it, and bear it. \r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nThe thing about the Heartbreak Hotel for me is that the writing of it kind of provides the temporality of the other room, the one you go into for a second to masturbate or vomit, and then you come back out and live your life a little bit more smoothly. And it\u2019s always there and you can always book yourself a vacation in the Heartbreak Hotel but you would never want to live there because it\u2019s a hotel.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cIt promises to never promise that it can be a home,\u201d I wrote. Was I saying this about the Heartbreak Hotel or about writing in general? I was experiencing the forgotten freedom of crafting my writing to a standard that wasn\u2019t already fixed in my head. This sensation was a homey sensation.\r\nBut there was the shifting problem of audience\u2014the outside lens that let me peer into my writing as something new and exciting. <i>I wanted to please an audience.</i> And it was exciting that, in the reader-writer relationship, whether I pleased an audience was a matter of <i>writing</i> rather than <i>being</i>. A different kind of passivity, a different kind of agency: I had the sense that the page would never give me what my words lacked\u2014that all of the plenitude writing gave me came from the writing itself, that I could never just offer myself up to Heartbreak Hotel and have things unfold for me as though automatically, as I had imagined offering myself up to my parents, to grad school, to particular/amalgamated boys, to a new life in China. None of these things were going to be the ship for me. In Heartbreak Hotel I found an aquarium to flounder in while I waited to be ready for the sea.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nWriting is a weird kind of freedom. You can do whatever you want but what\u2019s the point unless someone else would enjoy it or at least you would enjoy it? Eve Sedgwick has written beautifully on the way multiple energies in writing resolve themselves into a reader-friendly form in a disciplinary process that is not without pleasure:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThe main component of\u2026 \u201cauthority\u201d seems to me to be the presentation of a piece of writing as the now-under-control palimpsest of some earlier, plurivocal drama or struggle: among tones, among dictions, among genres. The visible marks of solicitous care and of self-repression, the scrupulously almost not legible map of exorbitance half-erased by discipline, the very \u201ccareful [one might add very pleasurable] orchestration of spontaneity and pageantry\u201d (the same with which one\u2019s parents took one over their lap): these stigmata of \u201cdecisiveness\u201d in and authority over one\u2019s language are recognizable as such by their family resemblance to the power, rage, and assault that parents present to the child with a demand for compulsory misrecognition of them as discretion and love.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nI love this description of the process of writing, but part of me desires something more. Isn\u2019t there writing that is just joyful and free, that forgets itself in the moment of writing and plays and burbles again, because it can, and when it remembers authority and audience, setting aside the pleasures of being an authority and of pleasing an authority for the exhilaration of being inappropriate, of being excessive, of being \u201citself,\u201d of taking pleasure in the public flaunting of norms and the display of your own personal grossness? Because maybe you can\u2019t know in advance what someone else would enjoy or what you would enjoy. Maybe there\u2019s something great about the exhibitionistic thrill of showing your writing, undone. Of writing stuff that you can\u2019t even quite bear to go back and look at after you\u2019ve put it down on the page knowing it\u2019s going to go public.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt seems that this is my queer relationship with writing. I take from Eve Sedgwick (and my friends) courage in my perverse desire to write like this, hoping, like a personal ad, that someone will want to be on the receiving end.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo, here I am. \r\n<p>\r\n(I feel like Eve Sedgwick and I have had similar experiences with parental authority.)\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nEvery time I type \u201chere I am\u201d it makes me laugh.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been typing it a lot when I don\u2019t know what to say next.\r\n\r\nIt feels different from typing \u201cthis is nothing.\u201d\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nLast night I went to the Occupy Lincoln General Assembly (I haven\u2019t done anything Occupy Lincoln-related in weeks) and signed up to help plan a party and an anti-consumer flash mob on Black Friday. I am helping to plan a community festival. And last night when the cops descended on Zuccotti, I participated in a strange open forum until 4 a.m., collective worry turned paranoid. I don\u2019t say these things to brag, exactly, or to justify myself, because I know it\u2019s such a small contribution. And yet:\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nCindy Crabb writes in her inspiring zine, DORIS:\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThere were ideas about how to go about life. One idea was that you had to fix yourself before you could fix the world. One idea was that the world was going to shit so fast there was no time for internal work, just revolution now. One idea was that the two things informed each other. That part of your inside problems were because of a lack of meaningful social engagement. I went with that one. (<i>The Encyclopedia of Doris,</i> p. 218)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\u2019ve been trying to reconcile all of these things, my privilege with my oppression, my logic with my whimsy, my youth with my growing up, my desires for sex or maybe just companionship with growing independent, and the loneliness too, and through it all I sometimes trust pleasure and I sometimes trust responsibility, and sometimes I trust conflicting things that different people say to me at different times. I want to come out into the public where I can participate in change but also I don\u2019t know how. These thoughts I think and the things I feel are so violent and inarticulate and just sit scared and irrelevant inside of me when I am at a GA, when I am at a forum, where they seem to be talking about things that won\u2019t help, where people sometimes seem like aliens. \r\n<p>\r\nBut I trust Cindy when she says that self-development and world change are a balancing act, except her point is that they don\u2019t have to be opposed, it doesn\u2019t have to be a matter of balancing the one with the other. I share her belief that you shouldn\u2019t have to lock up your crazy bits inside of you. You might have to find forms or rooms to do it in\u2014you gotta write the space where you can write!\u2014but letting them out in the world can be a good, regardless of whether the thing you\u2019ve let out is \u201cgood.\u201d And letting them out might create room for other things, other change. And, on the flip side, political action might help you write.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhat is this document that I\u2019ve created, even? Is it a self-case study? A document of my crazy so that other people can take me as a case study? A way to justify this weird thing I\u2019ve made so I can feel like I\u2019m not living in a vacuum? An article about Occupy? An article trying to wrap my head around (give a new voice to?) the whole weird depressed too-much-free-time entitled differently-privileged creatively-aspiring internetty deracinated generation that I\u2019m in, the one that feels the desire to occupy or be occupied or something or everything? \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI\u2019m kind of out on a limb here but it feels kind of nice. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI think I\u2019m a writer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr class=\"shorthr\"><br><br>\r\n\r\n<h3>APPENDIX</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nI think it\u2019s time to ask the old question again: what is \u201cgood\u201d writing? And the newly related question: what is good occupying?\r\n<p>\r\nMAKE IT FINISHED, they say. MAKE IT GOOD. BE ECONOMICAL. IF IT GENERATES TOO MUCH NOISE OR REQUIRES TOO MUCH THOUGHT, MAKE SURE IT\u2019S CLOSE TO THE HEART OF YOUR ESSAY.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe drum circles at Occupy Wall Street generated too much noise for the occupiers to hear each other at the GA. The neighbors were complaining, too. They decided to limit the drumming to two hours per day.\r\n<blockquote> \r\n\r\nJoshHarkinson<br>\r\n#OCCUPYWALLSTREET<br>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter victory today, a drummer<br>\r\nplayed for 2.5 hours, .5<br>\r\nmore than allowed. \u201c2 hours<br>\r\nwas not enough for my soul,\u201d <br>\r\nshe said. <br>\r\n<p>\r\n(via Occupy!, n+1\u2019s OWS-inspired gazette)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI see the Occupation as a brave unwritten text that is gathering to itself many readers and writers. But what are the writers trying to write, and how are the readers to judge the merits of this evolving text, to give helpful advice and feedback?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMAKE IT GOOD, he says. But when I close my eyes to try to imagine what\u2019s good I can only imagine all of the good things I\u2019ve seen before.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTHERE HAS NEVER BEEN A GOOD OCCUPATION.\r\n<p>\r\nIn order for the \u201cgood\u201d to arrive there must be room for it in the lives of the writers (cf. \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own\u201d) and the imaginary of the readers.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nMASTERPIECES are historical events and look very little like the evolving NOW.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAnd if a professor reads it and finds it lacking, what of it? Let us wipe clean the days of staying up too late inscribing facebook on our souls searching for the mysterious something that will make a professor think that something is good.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nWhich is not to say good work didn\u2019t happen this way. But who knows what would have happened without the constraints?\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cToday I\u2019m going to let you do whatever you want,\u201d my mother said one morning. I spent the whole day on the internet, on neopets\u2014just as she had predicted\u2014I had no self-control. Back to one hour of internet per day for me. Not that I didn\u2019t find ways to get around it.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nHere I am, and maybe I have indulged myself too long. Can we indulge each other this extra day, this extra half hour?\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nI GIVE GOOD ORAL!\r\n<p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\nThis is important because I think this<br>\r\nis what Occupy Wall Street is right now:<br>\r\nless of a movement and more of a space.<br>\r\n<p>\r\n(ibid.)\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nHow does one judge a space?

            "rendered_content": "<p>In the projectionist\u2019s booth, it\u2019s easy to lose track of time, but losing track of time is the worst mistake you could make. People won\u2019t really mind if the floors are sticky or the popcorn is stale, but there\u2019s a movie starting every five minutes, and God help the projectionist who starts it five seconds late. So try to ignore the sound of the film as it clicks and whirrs through the projector, each frame passing for a single, measured moment before the light of the plate and the eyes of the audience. Close your ears to the basso hum of the bulb. Like a mechanical lullaby, an impossibly rhythmic ocean, the even click of the film and the calibrated hum of the bulbs can lull you to sleep. Or, if not to sleep, into a lazy stupor: eyes filled with colors dancing on the screen below, ears filled with the mechanical click-click-click-click of the sprockets at their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first time Matt explains the sprockets to me, it just seems like showing off. He reels off the list faster than a frame can move through the projector: \u201cDigital soundhead, upper sprocket, plate, intermittent sprocket, lower sprocket, analog soundhead, bottom sprocket, failsafe.\u201d Each sprocket is just a fat steel cylinder with teeth for grabbing perforations on the edge of the film stock. When the projector runs, the sprockets spin and pull the film through at a constant rate. Matt shows me how to \u201cthread\u201d the labyrinth of sprockets and spools, how to frame the film over the plate, how to give slack after the upper sprocket and before the lower sprocket, how to spin the flywheel and work the intermittent sprocket, how to engage the failsafe, and how to wipe the oil off my hands after I\u2019m finished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt also shows me how to work the platter system. Forget everything about film being stored in upright reels, the classic two-humped silhouette of the old-school projector. In the modern multiplex, film is stored off to the side of the projector on horizontal platters. This saves theaters time by eliminating the hassle of rewinding. A basic reel-to-reel system can only move film from the outside of one reel to the inside of another, reversing its order in the process. In a platter system, film is pulled up from the <i>inside</i> of one platter, run through the projector, and collected on the inside of another platter, ready to be shown again. Of course, every solution carries along its own problems, and the problem with spooling film from the inside can be best illustrated by wrapping a string around your finger, then yanking on it. Instead of unwrapping neatly, the coils of string just get pulled tighter around the center. Similarly, a projector\u2019s endless hunger for film can pull the reel into thousands of tight, black ringlets. If these twists ever enter the projector, you have a gigantic mess on your hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The machine responsible for preventing this disaster is called the brain, a squat cylinder that sits at the center of the sending platter. Film moves from the inside of the reel, through the brain, and out to the projector. When the brain\u2019s arm is up, the projector pulls film as normal, but now the film coils around the brain instead of around itself. When the tension from this wrap builds up, it pulls the brain-arm down, telling the platter to rotate in reverse and unwrap the excess film. The brain can malfunction in many ways, but the most common is called a \u201cbrain wrap.\u201d This happens when the brain fails to sense the tension building up around it and allows the film to wrap forever. Friction builds up and the rate of film going to the projector slows, or tries to slow. Projectors must take in film at a rate of 24 frames per second, and they will bring the entire booth crashing down around them before accepting anything slower. The film may slow down, but the sprockets keep their own time, and their teeth will shred any film that resists. Usually, the film just breaks, but sometimes, Matt tells me, the friction can build up so high that it burns instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019m in the booth with Matt learning how to run the projectors because soon, our theater won\u2019t have any projectors to speak of. That is, we\u2019re in the process of going digital. Nearly half of our screens are already running on digital projectors, and Matt pauses briefly to show me how they work. Select a movie from the touchscreen. Press play. The projectors run silent. Next to each one, you can see a rusty orange footprint where one of the old platters once stood.</p>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<p>During three summers of work at the theater, I had never before been allowed in the projection booth, and I had only seen Matt on the days he worked as a floor manager. Young, thin, and sullen, his main managerial duties seemed to be checking his watch, taking cigarette breaks, and sighing. But in the dim light of the projection booth, Matt is a changed man. He can thread a projector in three minutes flat, and he can do it with one hand. He\u2019s memorized the projection schedule and starts each show on time to the second. He\u2019s even figured out how to replace a faulty brain while its movie is running. Midway through explaining how to run two projectors from one print of film, he snaps to attention, then dashes off across the booth to wrestle with a platter in the early stages of brain wrap. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve spent enough time up here,\u201d he explains breathlessly, eyes popped wide, \u201cyou get used to the sounds, and you can hear when something doesn\u2019t sound right.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt is training me how to do his job because the rise of digital projectors has suddenly made his job much easier. Day-to-day, a projectionist\u2019s only responsibility is threading and starting the movies. This is a very complicated procedure, but it can still be taught by rote, and I am the proof. Back when the theater ran entirely on film projectors, it took a lot of skill to keep up with the schedule. But with digital projectors that essentially run themselves, those skills are no longer necessary. Word has come in from corporate to start eliminating projectionists and filling their shifts with floor staff like me. Once we complete the transition to digital, the booth will be abandoned entirely. Instead, the manager will run the movies with his mouse. Click click click click.</p>\r\n<br/>\r\n<p>The booth isn\u2019t so much a booth as a long hallway, mirroring the line of theaters below. On the ground floor, each screen feels distant from the screen across the hall, but in the booth, the two projectors sit so close you can reach out and touch them both at the same time. It\u2019s as if the space of the theater has been condensed into a single line, a spine. Walking along its length, you can catch flashes of light and color on the screens below, each its own self-contained fantasy world, each world leading back to the booth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from six discarded film projectors, a different kind of salvage lines the long walls of the booth. A cardboard crowd of Hollywood actors and actresses jostles for position with aliens, robots, and singing chipmunks. All of the scowling and smiling faces are refugees from freestanding advertisements that once graced the theater lobby. The collection is impressive, but it\u2019s packed densely around the start of the booth, where the projectors for the largest theaters sit. Those larger theaters are now serviced by digital projectors, and that end of the booth is shrouded in silence. In this silence, the frozen poses and cardboard grins take on a more sinister quality, and I am reminded of the projectionists who came before me. Back when the whole hall hummed with film, they lined the booth with the stuff of dreams; something to keep them company at night while they waited for the last reel to drop. But times have changed, and the poster people will soon have no one to keep company. The fake figures feel left behind, abandoned, a sort of human residue. Things can move very slowly in the booth, until\u2013Matt snaps to attention\u2013they suddenly move all too fast.</p>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<p>The intermittent sprocket, as its name might suggest, turns just once for every four turns of the other sprockets, but it\u2019s easily the most important. While the intermittent sprocket lies dormant, the upper sprocket ticks off a frame of film, letting it gather just above the plate. Then, the intermittent sprocket engages, yanking the current frame off the plate and replacing it with the new one. As this happens, the shutter closes for a split-second to mask the switch. In the end, the audience sees only a series of still images and never the transitions between them. This is the fundamental illusion of moving pictures.</p>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n<p>It\u2019s my first shift alone in the booth, and I\u2019ve completely lost it. I was trained under the assumption that everything would work perfectly, that nothing over the course of my six hour shift would slip, snap, or tangle. But the projectors and the platters weren\u2019t designed to run perfectly; they were designed to run fast and dirty, under the watchful eyes of someone who knows how to fix them when they break. As long as people have sat in theaters and watched the movies, someone has sat behind them and <i>watched</i> the movies. From the old changeover systems, where the projectionist had to manually switch from one 20-minute reel to the other, to the present day, there has always been someone there to ensure that the show runs smoothly, and above all, that it starts on time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I reach again for my radio, I can feel that grand tradition slipping away. I\u2019ve already called the manager upstairs twice, both times to sort out tangled fistfuls of film that had somehow escaped the brain and spiraled into chaos. I\u2019ve since resolved to watch my brains closely, to always ensure that they are \u201cthinking\u201d (my own word for the action of the brain-arm). For my troubles, I\u2019ve been hypnotized by the platter at Theater 7. My exhausted eyes turn along with the now-clockwise, now-counterclockwise spiral of the film. The strobe of the shutter flashes just on the edge of sight, and I listen carefully over the clicking sprockets for the faint sucking sound of film peeling off the main platter and starting its long journey to the projector. The radio on my belt breaks the reverie. \u201cAndy\u2026have you started 3 yet?\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I immediately jump up and sprint down the length of the booth, mumbling something vague into the radio. 3 was supposed to start 15 minutes ago; I must have been watching my brain for over 20. It\u2019s a Wednesday afternoon, and nobody\u2019s in the theater, but I\u2019ve still failed an important test. This is the last projection shift I\u2019ll be given for a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<center><img src=\"/media/images/11/brain.jpg\" class=\"picture\"><br><i>Illustration by Wesley Ryan Clapp</i></center>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt taught me the importance of always spinning the flywheel before working with the intermittent sprocket. The flywheel rotates along with the standard sprockets, but for a quarter of each cycle, it engages the intermittent sprocket too. This is how the sprocket can lie in wait for three clicks and spring to life on the fourth. Spinning the flywheel with your hand will rotate the intermittent sprocket manually and show you when it will turn in projection. You can line the first frame up perfectly, but if the intermittent sprocket fails to turn when you expect, it will spoil the whole rest of the movie, show the audience the gap between frames, ruin the illusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">*click*</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forget everything about film being stored on gigantic platters. In the multiplex of the future, there is no film. This saves theaters time by eliminating the hassle of carrying, storing, building, splicing, threading, and untangling. Instead, movies are stored on thumb drives and downloaded onto a projector for the duration of their theatrical release. Of course, every solution carries along its own problems, and the problem with eliminating film from the projection process can be best illustrated by inserting plugs into your ears, then screaming. Instead of releasing you, the film just wraps tighter and tighter around your brain, and you have a gigantic mess on your hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt knows the exact date when he will turn off the lights for the last time and leave the booth to its army of grinning cardboard cutouts. Most of the other projectionists have already been forced out, but Matt has stayed on as a floor manager and trainer to the interim projectionists. He also works in the booth on weekends, when the stakes are too high to bring in a newbie. If he knows what\u2019s good for him, Matt should be looking for another job, but I have my doubts that he is. I don\u2019t know if he can feel the tension building up around him, or the forces gathering to yank him out of frame. Instead, he\u2019s stuck listening to the click of the film and the hum of the bulb, and he\u2019s not going to move until something finally breaks, or burns. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

Around 25% of employed graduates, according to the Yale Office of Institutional Research, were entering these lucrative but perhaps ethically compromised professions. Keegan was modest, admitting she was no authority on careers or other people's lives. Yet this statistic clearly troubled her. She talked about the experience of being around talented, creative people and the fear that the tug of these jobs threatened their ability to accomplish something. There were a couple nods toward the issue of whether such professions contribute anything to society, if they do anything to help anyone besides those who work in them. More space was given to what this choice meant for those making it: what kinds of thoughts and pressures went into the decision to take such jobs, whether the motivations weren't rationalizations, and if there wasn't something terribly sad about this being the compromise people make.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\u2019ve deliberately given a neutral, quote-free summary of the piece. This is because, after the article was sent out to my group of friends, many of them seriously objected to the way it was written. They said things like \u201cI very much wish that the style of this piece didn't call so much attention to itself\u201d and \u201cI'm quite turned off by all this \u2018I don't know anything about this BUT LET ME TELL YOU MY OBVIOUS THOUGHTS THAT YOU HAVE TOO oh and can you tell from how I write that I'm a little bit\u2014but not totally\u2014hipster?\u2019\u201d Take a look at some of Keegan's verbiage:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\u201cThis is a big deal.

I suppose it made sense, when blogging was new, that there was some confusion about voice. Was a blog more like writing or more like speech? Soon it became a contrived and shambling hybrid of the two.

Still, there's no denying that a vaguely Wallace-like idiom has become increasingly common. While reading the quotes from the Keegan piece above, you may have had a flash of recognition, or thought \u201cThis looks like something I\u2019ve encountered before.\u201d Marina Keegan, I think, uses just about every tic of Newton's \u201cblogger lexicon\u201d; one could say her analysis is \u201cobscured behind a veneer of folksiness and sincerity and is characterized by an unwillingness to be pinned down,\u201d as Newton writes. This style pops up on Tumblr, on lousy websites like <a href=\"http://thoughtcatalog.com/\">Thought Catalog</a> and good ones like <a href=\"http://www.theawl.com/\">The Awl</a>. (Though it\u2019s a necessary disclaimer that this is only one corner of the Internet and a small percentage of its users.) It has become increasingly ubiquitous, reaching its tendrils out into less bloggy outlets, creating a sense that this is a natural way to write. While working on this essay, despite feeling acutely aware of phraseology, I kept finding loose-hanging \u2018pretty much\u2019s and \u2018really\u2019s slipping in<sup><a name=\"id1\" href=\"#ft1\">1</a></sup>. All this makes it, at the very least, a thing to be reckoned with for writers. Wallace's essay \u201cE Unibus Pluram\u201d argues that television\u2019s use of irony cribbed from postmodern writers presents a challenge, but not necessarily a blockade, for his generation. In much the same way, the \u201cThis is something I think is pretty okay! But we should, like, talk about it!\u201d voice deserves at least a friendly wrestle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Newton argues that the ascent of this style reflects a \u201cdeep confusion\u201d about audience and voice, I think it\u2019s actually come out of or come to stand in for a fairly coherent, but largely unarticulated rhetorical stance. That is, it isn\u2019t just a slapdash grab-bag of tics and techniques, the twee Tourette\u2019s of youthful yearners, but an expression of an actual position or worldview that, even if you dislike it or find it irritating, is responding to some genuine problems that just about anyone trying to write critically has to deal with in one way or another. A quick definition of this style might be that it's what you get when you really, really don't want to assert any kind of rhetorical authority. Any pretensions of expertise, experience, professionalism, most of the traditional markers of \u2018good\u2019 writing have to go by the wayside. The aesthetic is one of deliberate sloppiness, including meandering, conjunction-heavy sentences and excessively punctuated, typographically ostentatious writing, as well as an insistently informal tone and familiarity in the many direct addresses to the audience. When there\u2019s the risk of making a definitive statement, the style emphasizes the alternate values of openness, desire for nuance, self-expression, including process, in order to not dishonestly exclude what went into the making of the more definitive claims. Its rhetorical hallmarks typically emerge in attempts to flatten the relationship between writer and reader, ironizing of the role of the critic or journalist, and a concern\u2014perhaps self-defeating\u2014with demonstrating the sincerity of the writer. A close reading of Keegan\u2019s article, which I take to be an accidental exemplar of this style and the broader trends that give rise to its appeal, will bring out the concerns that give rise to this style, and why it might not be the most productive way of addressing them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To figure out what he was up to, Newton quoted Wallace on the \u201cEthical Appeal\u201d: it\u2019s \u201ca complex and sophisticated \u2018Trust me,\u2019\u201d one that \u201crequires the rhetor to convince us not just of his intellectual acuity or technical competence, but of his basic decency and fairness and sensitivity to the audience\u2019s own hopes and fears.\u201d Wallace\u2019s point, which Newton spells out more clearly, is that the ethical appeal is premised on the sincerity of the speaker, and sincerity, which claims to be free of the messy trappings of performance, is itself performed, mediated, in a subtler but more suspicious way than other rhetorical devices, and this leads down recursive pathways that bring Newton to call for straightforwardness (and led Wallace in a whole bunch of different directions including AA). Keegan and many online writers are also making an ethical appeal, but an unusual one, quite different from a dictionary editor\u2019s \u201cTrust me.\u201d Trust me because I\u2019m flawed, confused, still working things out for myself\u2014but most of all, trust me because I write like you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key elements of this style is its informality. It\u2019s how you talk to your friends online, or perhaps how the writer imagines you talk to your friends. To some of my friends, the familiarity of the Keegan piece felt necessarily false. It\u2019s a cause for suspicion if someone who is not your friend talks to you as if they are\u2014usually they\u2019re trying to sell you something. Newton argues there is something sneaky about this, that it's an attempt to win readers' confidence without actually earning it. It's worth asking why this familiarity is something writers reach for. The friendliness, rather than being disrespectful or a sign of a con, strikes me as aspirational. Its argument is that if you write or behave in a certain way, put up the trappings of friendliness, of \u201ccommunity,\u201d that you can help a conversational community to exist, or at least nudge the discourse toward the practices of one that would take place in such a community. Rather than the agonistic model of pugilistic debate, this aims to be more like direct democracy, standing up to speak at a general assembly, with authority deriving from membership in the community, from sharing its values and concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Keegan\u2019s article these stylistic tics are repeatedly associated with traditional journalistic activities\u2014interviewing people, citing sources, etc. \u201cKevin Hicks \u201989, former dean of Berkeley College, thinks it\u2019s a load of crap,\u201d she writes to introduce one section; \u201cI conducted a credible and scientific study in L-Dub courtyard earlier this week \u2014 asking freshman after freshman what they thought they might be doing upon graduation\u201d somewhere else. It\u2019s like an intrusive narrator reminding the reader that a work of fiction is mediated. One way to read this is that calling attention to the ritualized, mockable aspects of journalism actually reinforces her authority to comment. It\u2019s ironic journalism or criticism: the writer is in fact writing a piece of journalism or criticism, but emphasizes all the ways in which she isn\u2019t a journalist or critic and flouts the behavior expected of these, and this is supposed to, although this isn't acknowledged, make the actual journalistic or critical work more legitimate and trustworthy. Alternately, it\u2019s as if she keeps feeling the need to say \u201cI\u2019m not like that! I\u2019m one of you!\u201d whenever something that might be read as an assertion of authority comes up. A more formal style, with the trappings of journalistic objectivity and authority, distances the writer from the reader and from the community and burdens the writer into doing things she doesn't want to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The writing asserts its own naturalness, as if to say this is how people in the community would talk, and that what's natural is truer and more honest. There\u2019s a long history of writers trying to adopt the vernacular or the rhythms of spoken language in an effort to achieve just that. Here, the vernacular isn\u2019t oral, but written\u2014the language of commenting and chatting. But to suggest that this voice is just a reaction to norms of objectivity in favor of community misses some of the details. It often isn\u2019t exactly friendly\u2014instead, it\u2019s sort of petulant, aggressively childish, arch but bratty, almost tweeny<sup><a name=\"id2\" href=\"#ft2\">2</a></sup>. It's a commonplace that people today are engaged in the production of text at a higher rate than ever before. Part of this is the simultaneous use of informal and formal registers, as in posting Facebook comments while writing a paper or Gchatting in the office. It's hard to not think that most people are highly conscious of voice. The trouble isn\u2019t that online writing isn\u2019t expressive enough, as is often suggested to explain the proliferation of slang, but that it\u2019s too expressive, too semantically loaded with the linguistic detritus of rapidly bursting microcultures. The internet has given us many things, prominent among them textually marked gestures of refusal to participate in conversation. There are so many ways of expressing frustration or contempt, acting above or below things, and this rhetoric quickly diffuses to people more intellectually developed than the 14-year-old in the YouTube comments. Its availability allows people to perform an ironic childishness, one that says something like, \u201cI could be reasonable, argue in your mature adult way, but I don\u2019t want to.\u201d Here\u2019s us kids playing, none of the grownups around, it says with a wink. We\u2019re all in on the joke. Newton harps on the faux-Midwestern use of the address \u201cfolks,\u201d but how about \u201ckids\u201d? This ironic childishness, used by people fully capable of being more articulate, can bind together an in-group but also define an out-group, people turned off by it or unable to understand why people would do this. I think this is a key part of this voice\u2019s appeal\u2014it allows readers and writers to feel like they\u2019re sharing an inside joke, but whatever the joke is, it\u2019s also public and lots of people get it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The blurring of public and private communication is not purely a stylistic question. Especially since it\u2019s foregrounded in Keegan\u2019s article, it's worth asking how these ideas about writing relate to capitalism. Many of Keegan\u2019s objections to what the finance industry does are easily transposed to certain types of writing. It's homogenous, erodes individuality, creates groupthink and conformity, has no room for creativity or individual development\u2014sounds like a newsroom. Certain stylistic criticisms strongly resemble economic discourse. If Marina Keegan were to choose to take a consulting job, she would likely be preparing reports arguing for efficiency, calling for trimming the fat and toughening up businesses in much the same way that critics ask for clearer writing. So it might seem like a small gesture of resistance to write in this way. Yet at the same time this idea of narrowing the gap between speaker and audience has been wholly taken up by advertising, which also attempts to talk directly to you, insinuates itself as your cool friend. Advertising advertises itself as the hip, creative counterpart to capitalism, and the rise of the internet has led to the uncomfortable realization that lots and lots of people are willing to essentially do marketing for free on behalf of brands. More than that, people interact with each other as brands, creating problematic discourses of sincerity and authenticity in response that perhaps only accelerate the movement toward commodification of the self.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where to turn? Note how the Keegan essay aspires to suggest something is a problem, or gesture toward a space in which issues can be raised and problems can be acknowledged, but nowhere presents anything recognizable as a program or solution. The idea is more to register the sense that something is off, and in communal recognition of this find some kind of understanding. This style almost seems like a precursor to Occupy Wall Street, which has received attention for refusing to make demands. The desire to step back and think about process, to be more concerned with the conditions under which different voices can speak and be heard, to negotiate the boundaries of discursive space, is in many respects laudable. At the same time, I can\u2019t shake the fear that we\u2019re simply trying to exchange one form of self-absorption for another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Critics of purported stylistic excess from Orwell\u2019s \u201cPolitics and the English Language\u201d to Newton often make a connection between succinct expression and clarity of thought. An overblown or overly self-involved style suggests intellectual laziness, confusion, or impedes argument and expression of ideas. I\u2019d like to turn this around and suggest that many of the elements under attack here represent alternative values which many writers might reasonably prefer. One person\u2019s straightforwardness might be another\u2019s reductiveness, one\u2019s clarity another\u2019s rigidity. One might legitimately prefer a subjective, experiential account of the writer\u2019s thought process and personal background to an argument presented as a pure exercise in abstract logic. Yet not every departure from the bland style of the op-ed is created equal, or equally appealing, and it\u2019s flawed pieces like Keegan\u2019s that show what\u2019s at stake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I see in this aspirational communal style is a discomfort with journalistic objectivity, critical pretentiousness or bombast, academic rigidity\u2014perhaps, given the apparent age of many of its users, the formalized style of paper-writing. There\u2019s a healthy suspicion embedded here, I think, of overly formalized writing. Who made the rules that govern the way you're supposed to write? What if these rules are insufficient for what we want to express, or inhibit us from expressing what\u2019s more important or more interesting than what they permit? Beyond that, there\u2019s a sense that (as editor Michael Kinnucan put it to me) \u201cour intelligence has disappointed us,\u201d and we need to find another way of doing things. The way that's been come up with is trying to unlearn things. Getting away from overly formalized writing and intellectualized thinking also means leaving behind a problematic way of (as a somewhat frustrating phrase has it) being in the world. Suspicion of the mind leads to looking for something external to the self found in other human beings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some ways the primary Wallace text for this mindset isn\u2019t the more complex and erudite reportage and critical essays, but his commencement address at Kenyon College\u2014an earnest and sometimes powerful speech, quite good by the standards of such things, but a preachier, less nuanced Wallace than the one many people admire. The speech perhaps makes the most sense in the context of <a href=\"http://www.theawl.com/2011/04/inside-david-foster-wallaces-private-self-help-library\">Wallace\u2019s interest in self-help books</a>. Wallace warned against solipsism and self-absorption\u2014how we all end up worshipping things, and none of these help. In the part of the speech that perhaps rang truest for many aspiring writers, he cautioned, \u201cWorship your intellect, being seen as smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.\u201d \u201cIt is not the least bit coincidental,\u201d he said (in a sentence excised from the version published after his suicide as <i>This Is Water</i>), \u201cthat adults who commit suicide with firearms almost always shoot themselves in the head.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an essay in <a href=\"http://www.thepointmag.com/2009/essays/death-is-not-the-end\">The Point</a>, Jon Baskin gave the best analysis I\u2019ve seen of the tension between irony and sincerity in Wallace\u2019s writing. Baskin argues that there is a programmatic element to Wallace\u2019s use of irony and self-criticism. Wallace deploys these tropes as a way to gradually lead readers away from solipsism. \u201cThe maze of contemporary thinking would have to be dismantled from within,\u201d Baskin writes, but Wallace\u2019s writing is about the constant fear of failure to do so. In Baskin\u2019s view:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The full radicality\u2014or conservatism, depending on your point of view\u2014of the stance expressed by Jest can be stated as follows: a good theory does not amount to a good life; self-examination should take place only within rigorous limits; true therapy helps the subject escape from his head... Wallace was often accused of fashionable postmodern pretension, which inverts his potential vulnerability. Critics could more accurately fault Wallace for the kind of reactionary dogmatism associated with the late Tolstoy, whose turn to folk Christianity had a similar structure and motivation as Wallace\u2019s valorization of AA.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Newton\u2019s criticism of a desire to be liked, I think, falls short of this, but gets in some ways to the same point. Before trying to escape from our heads, discovering humanity in clich\u00e9s and AA, it might be worth trying to go a little farther. There\u2019s a real anti-intellectual current hiding in plain sight behind a lot of this stuff, often expressed with the word \u201ccommunity,\u201d and just because Wallace could often walk that balance beam doesn't mean everyone can. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\"><p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft1\" href=\"#id1\">1</a></sup>\r\nYou can be sure that every \u201csort of\u201d in this article appears solely because it is the most precise and rhetorically effective way to express a particular point.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"footnote\"><p>\r\n<sup><a name=\"ft2\" href=\"#id2\">2</a></sup>\r\nNow for some serious equivocation. While working on this piece, I worried a lot about the gender dynamics of this style. I had the nagging suspicion that it was gendered as female, and this was a problem for me. Yes, Maud Newton, a woman, was making what might be the traditional masculine argument, in favor of tough prose and chiseled, whittled arguments, and David Foster Wallace, a man, represents the more traditionally feminine stereotype of indecision, interest in other people, and emotional underpinnings (albeit while also being cast in the very masculine role of progenitor.) Still, I\u2019m picking on a woman\u2019s writing here. I wonder if a lot of those Tumblrs and blog posts that left an impression of this style in the hazy, generalizing portion of my mind weren\u2019t written disproportionately by women\u2014or, recursively, if I only think this because these same gendered stereotypes about how people write are leading me to this worry. I wonder if I hear a neutral journalistic voice as masculine, and so if I\u2019m right about it or if that\u2019s the problem. If I\u2019m in some way calling out how other people are writing, am I just being a male voice of authority telling other people what they\u2019re doing is wrong, and that it\u2019s wrong because a man says so? I\u2019m going to follow the lead of my subject and leave some tough questions unresolved in a footnote.\r\n</p>\r\n</div>",

Looking up: no clouds, no sun spottable to break it up, it simply rose and rose and rose. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFocus your eyes on the court. Here are two girls, sophomores of that prestigious madhouse, playing. One is Em, pretty but thick, with a thick brown ponytail and a tennis skirt that is, despite her efforts, riding up to expose pimply hamhocks.

She isn\u2019t, and the ground in Chicago is flat. Perhaps the gasping came on account of the cigarette breaks, taken at the end of each match. And as for the lame play? Well. Simone\u2019s blouse was far too thin, and on account of her own thinness she was the type to have regressed to flatchestedness and so thought she could get away with croptops or nothing. But believe me, starvation won\u2019t change the size of one\u2019s nipples, and so those hardly sheathed jewels pluckered out into the limelight as incongruous demands of her soft, fragrant sensuality. And they were there, so Em couldn\u2019t help but look.<sup><a name=\"id3\" href=\"#ft3\">3</a></sup>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThey are through\u2014headed back to the apartment. Em lumps alongside the bubbly Simone. Simone of the Pink Face. Not to call her pink-faced\u2014on the contrary, her skin is white, translucent\u2014but within her face. I imagine the wet pink seeping from the corners of her eyes, like a cocker spaniel\u2026 She is gummy\u2014gums are pink. Also, pockmarks. Faintish pinkish scars across her nose and cheeks: the remnants of terrible acne. Here is something that Em will not notice until a long time afterwards\u2014until she is piecing together the bits of Simone\u2019s face, and, cradling these pink pocks, will puzzle as to what they were for. And when she realizes, she will experience a fierce yank in the belly: the impeccable, impenetrable Simone was once ugly, and had known its shame. And she, Em, had been facing those marks for the whole of their friendship and had refused to see them. We are blind. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSimone is jabbering. \u201cI\u2019ve finished, finally. Built from below up\u2014reach the night face up\u2014wallpapered the penthouse graffitied in trips and Freudian slips, finishing touches were the mirrors for the mirror stage, you know how it is.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<i>How can I tell you any of this?</i> I wanted to convey a little world. There are a zillion little souls out there screaming to be heard, scratching at the screens in their ugly little voices, nasal, scratching, and it is enough to make your fingers tickle. Like you\u2019d like to press and push your fingertips together to stop all the tickling and feel it all turn to chalk. And inside, there is air rising, there is a bubble growing within Em\u2019s belly\u2014empty, expansive, full of anguish, because she doesn\u2019t know what to listen to and what not to listen to anymore. Because she had to tune it all out because it was all lies but she doesn\u2019t know what to trust and what to not, but she taught herself how to not and now she does not know how to go back.  \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are few birds left cheeping in the bare sky above.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nUpon return, Simone shows Em her latest creation. The story is composed purely of images, thick. There is nothing to say about it. It confuses Em\u2014she can\u2019t keep the pronouns straight, and she\u2019s not clear on the plot. Once Em has finished, she doesn\u2019t know what she could say, so she stays quiet for a long time\u2014her head bent over the white sheets, pretending that she is still reading. She can feel Simone, waiting, patiently, behind her. She can smell Simone, the damp imprint of sweat that has risen from inside her. Watching behind her. Waiting for her to speak\u2026\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u2026For everything, to Simone, was simply an object to fit into one of her stories. And it seemed her interests changed with every word she spat\u2014gypsies, stockings, Artaud, Kaballah, Deleuze, clothes pins, Lacan, Poland, salt flats, kitsch, Antarctica, <i>The Passion of Joan of Arc,</i> Judas\u2014and all for the purpose of writing. Everything was an object to pick and throw away, to experiment with as a new writing style\u2014for she was determined to be a writer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIt is easy for Simone to act. It is easy to act when you have something to act for, when it all becomes toys, beautiful objects to arrange around you.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEm leaves for a walk. Behind campus, the houses\u2014broken, chunks of their foundation disappeared as if bitten by a yeti\u2014prepare for Halloween: polyester cobwebs knowingly spread across chain link fence, grey; and beyond that, the sky again. The sky is the sky until it hits the earth\u2014and even then, the earth reflects, glistens, this presence. <i>This is how it always is\u2026</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThis. It is in <i>this</i> that she can trust: it is only in <i>this</i> that there could be answers. But what? She cannot speak to it and it will not speak to her. We cannot speak to it; we can only keep trying, in all that we do, to speak of it. And if we please, it will recede seamlessly into our backdrop\u2014though that won\u2019t change it\u2014it is here.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd when the light shifts, then the gloaming comes, it is the same. Shadows shrink, distend with the pitch of time\u2014faces and buildings grow long\u2014and darkness. This too is the same.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShe never had this conversation with Simone. At the start of their friendship she tried, walking together by the water, a duck.  She recited a poem.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\nI don\u2019t get tired of you. Don\u2019t grow weary<br/>\r\nof being compassionate toward me! <br/>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAll this thirst equipment<br/>\r\nmust surely be tired of me, <br/>\r\nthe waterjar, the water carrier.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nI have a thirsty fish in me<br/>\r\nthat can never find enough<br/>\r\nof what it\u2019s thirsty for! <br/>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nShow me the way to the ocean! <br/>\r\nBreak these half-measures, these small containers. <br/>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAll this fantasy<br/>\r\nand grief. <br/>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nLet my house be drowned in the wave<br/>\r\nthat rose last night in the courtyard<br/>\r\nhidden in the center of my chest. <br/>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nJoseph fell like the moon into my well. <br/>\r\nThe harvest I expected was washed away. <br/>\r\nBut no matter. <br/>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nA fire has risen above my tombstone hat. <br/>\r\nI don\u2019t want learning, or dignity, <br/>\r\nor respectability. <br/>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nI want this music and this dawn<br/>\r\nand the warmth of your cheek against mine. <br/>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe grief-armies assemble, <br/>\r\nbut I\u2019m not going with them. <br/>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThis is how it always is <br/>\r\nwhen I finish a poem. <br/>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nA great silence comes over me, <br/>\r\nand I wonder why I ever thought<br/>\r\nto use language.<sup><a name=\"id4\" href=\"#ft4\">4</a></sup>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cBe careful\u2014I hear he\u2019s a god-awful translator,\u201d Simone said.<sup><a name=\"id5\" href=\"#ft5\">5</a></sup>\r\n \u201cBut it\u2019s sweet! Oh, Em, you\u2019re cute. Look at Em, my mystic friend. My crunchy friend.\u201d And when Em protested, Simone\u2014ever eager for critical debate\u2014flashed back. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? Don\u2019t you see what you\u2019re doing\u2014it\u2019s exactly the same. Except yours is dangerous\u2014it won\u2019t tell you anything, Em. You won\u2019t get anywhere with yours.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAnd so the world appeared to tremble beneath Simone\u2019s precious mouth\u2014she is able, with a single shard uttered, to pickle the world into a crude mass of pearls singing from her throat. Masturbation. That\u2019s what it all is, if we do anything with it\u2014the world becomes our pornography, and we transcend every time we come, mastering it, the masochist with his whip. And what we see will become a throw-up of mirrors, shining back at us our faces. We will see our faces everywhere\u2014twisted, crumpled, haughty.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHaven\u2019t you been here before? Can\u2019t you hear all these paunchy males, whinnying and braying? What happens when the noise takes over, and you cannot see the world anymore? Not that you could ever see it. But it was beautiful once. And now, here she is, and everyone is telling her that it\u2019s a lie. <i>Think critically, think the world, make the world, make it work for you.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n Everyone is telling her to rise up. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\r\nHumans. We are born half animal and half god\u2014but it is in flux. You choose\u2014whether to indulge your animal side or your god side. Most people are animals\u2014 look at them.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n Munch, munch, munching at the viands.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is what they say. The mallard floated in the muck. The world is sinking.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is how it begins. It begins with Em losing a battle. Don\u2019t you know how hard it is, when someone is telling you that you are acting silent, don\u2019t you know how hard it is to force yourself to speak?<sup><a name=\"id6\" href=\"#ft6\">6</a></sup>\r\nAnd how angry it makes you\u2014because maybe before the silence was helping you to connect to <i>something</i>... But now\u2014how are you supposed to not be quiet when every moment goes by and you have her voice in your head urging you <i>speak up</i>\u2014\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBecause now Em is stuck. What was once beautiful turns to rot, holes in your teeth. But she clings on to the silence, because it was good before - though it has grown deformed\u2014telling herself that it still represents something of higher value; and she resents Simone, for she cannot do anything now for fear that it will distort. She lies on her bed\u2014she cannot move. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cI wonder if they have gypsies in Israel!\u201d Simone yaks away in the kitchen.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<p>\r\nOutside, everyone\u2019s becoming increasingly squirrelish. Small women in leather coats squirreling away outside bakeries with burgundy claws full of chips chewing them with their front teeth. \r\n<p>&nbsp;<p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\r\nTRANSCENDENCE. <i>What Can I Do to Make You Believe Me.</i>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n \u201cDid you play with her genitals?\u201d<br/>\r\n\u201cNah, man. I couldn\u2019t even get her bra off.\u201d <br/>\r\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve played with her genitals.\u201d <br/>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d <br/>\r\n\u201cStart with the genitals next time, man.\u201d <br/>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d <br/>\r\n\u201cYeah.

Noah himself is slightly chiller: he has the swagger and the addiction that often comes with those who know they will never need to work a day in their life. He is small, with small hands, boat shoes and a bandana accenting hair that sticks straight out like Dylan. Noah is a writer, so he keeps on his person a legal pad and a sharpie wherever he goes\u2026\r\n</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<p>\r\n<b>[CHUNK IS MISSING.]</b> <sup><a name=\"id8\" href=\"#ft8\">8</a></sup>  \r\n<p>&nbsp;<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simone dreamt that she was in a white nightgown, and Noah mounted her. And she couldn\u2019t move. Simone acts this out for Em now. Her white nightgown hangs on her like a sheet \r\non a hanger. The sun beats down on the floor.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t move\u2014I was paralyzed.\u201d She demonstrates\u2014she draws together her shoulders, placing her hands and arms flat against the front of her body, stands still like that, paralyzed, for a moment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cAnd then\u2014you know the face that Noah makes? When he looks like a goblin? Well, he makes this face sometimes. Sometimes his face is totally angelic, but sometimes he\u2014he looks like a monster.\u201d  She pauses, touches a finger to an elbow, shudders, for a moment. \u201cHe starts having sex with me, and I am totally paralyzed, my legs feel dead, numb, like I have no connection to them. I can\u2019t lift my arms, and I can\u2019t speak, either. And then his face\u2014he is looking at me, his face is close to mine, and he turns into a goblin! And he is laughing, and it is so, so terrible.\u201d\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u201cMmm,\u201d says Em. \u201cThat sucks. That sounds like a really bad dream.\u201d<br/>\r\n\t\u201cOh, no! Sweetpie,\u201d says a third. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible. I\u2019m so sorry. That\u2019s awful.\u201d <br/>\r\n\t\u201cYes,\u201d says Simone. \u201cIt is. Well.\u201d She looks distressed. \u201cI\u2019m going back to bed.\u201d <br/>\r\n\tShe retreats. Em and the third return to the dishes; later, the two meet for a movie. The third asks Em if she\u2019d heard from Simone\u2014\u201cshe says she fainted.\u201d <br/>\r\n\t\u201cReally? What happened?\u201d <br/>\r\n\t\u201cI guess she hadn\u2019t eaten all day. And then, she took some pill\u2014\u201d<br/>\r\n\t\u201cWhat pill?\u201d <br/>\r\n\t\u201cUh, it\u2019s unclear. Some pill she got. But anyway, yeah, and she was feeling sort of queasy\u2014\u201c<br/>\r\n\t\u201cShe should\u2019ve had something to eat.\u201d <br/>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u201cYeah. Well. She was feeling sort of queasy, and then she said she was standing in the kitchen, and she collapsed, and has a bruise, or something\u2026 She sounds really upset. She wants us to come home, now, and help her. She wants us to bring her soup.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u201cSoup? I want to go to the movie. Didn\u2019t you tell her we\u2019re going to a movie?\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAfterwards, as they wait for a takeout egg drop soup, Em speaks. \u201cIt was too beautiful. Nobody has dreams like that.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d says the third. The third sounds tired. They return home. Simone is perched on her bed, scribbling on a legal pad. Em places the soup on her table, as directed. Simone follows to the kitchen to show where she fell\u2014she shows the place on the doorframe where her side hit the wall. She shows where she lay, crumpled. She shows the faint bruise on her hip that has emerged. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<p>\r\n<b>\r\n[CHUNK IS MISSING. FANTASY BELOW (\u201cIN MY GRANDMOTHER\u2019S DREAM\u201d) TO MAKE UP FOR THE MISSING CHUNK.] <sup><a name=\"id9\" href=\"#ft9\">9</a></sup>  \r\n\r\n</b>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<p>\r\n\r\n<i>\r\n<p>She had been sleeping. She had not even known he was in the bed with her, but now she wakes to him mounting her. She suppresses her startle. She barely recognizes what he intends to do\u2013he has not tried to enter her for weeks, at least. It was an almost forgotten activity. But now he is ready. A flash of resentment strikes: he must have been stirred by a sexy dream, why now, why always on his terms, in the morning when he has a morning boner that has nothing to do with her, or at times like these... But she leaves it at that. She is learning to let her thoughts pass and slip out of her. Very Zen-like, she tells herself, because nothing good will come from thinking these thoughts. Better to make good with the good that he is here, now\u2014so she readies herself, changes her startle into her most bewitching look, and he mounts, and she looks bewitching, and as he does she realizes\u2014her eyes still set in that stare\u2013with real horror now that there is no hole there, that she is as smooth and seamless as his yellow face. What once was a slit has simply vanished as if it was never there. Even her insides feel full, solid. Like it was never there. Like there is nothing missing now.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBecause maybe before it felt like something was missing but now it is solid, like the hard, solid meat of a tuna steak, like mahogany. Except it can only be horror that she feels\u2014maybe she feels an instant of good at her new found solidity, like nothing is wrong, nothing is missing\u2014but if there ever was even a second of that it would vanish for surely he will be angry when he finds out that there is something wrong, that he can\u2019t. She makes a move to stop him but he looks at her set, with those dead eyes, sallow, opiate; eyes that in her most poetic moments reminds her of plums, the inside of the eyes almost\u2014at spots\u2014the color of the flesh of a plum, deep yellow, and on the inner rims, and running down in rivulets from his broken eye flesh, dark lines of black red, the skin of the plum. He looks at her with those plum eyes, always unmoving, and his thick lips, set in that grimace of disdain, of disappointment, at all that she has failed to bring. He looks at her as if she was not there, and he does not process her trying to push him off now frantically; trying to push him off with one hand and hold his sunken chest at bay, and the other hand pulling down at her nightgown so he won\u2019t be able to see what she is missing, what she has filled.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut he does not process, and he quietly takes her wrists up in a hand and uses the other to hold his base and he pushes against her solid mass and she shuts her eyes and he slips into her. And she is amazed that he has slipped into her because she has been a solid mass but as soon as she does she feels that the solidity, now, is writhing. And when he leaves to return there is a sucking noise, a slurping noise, suction. And she lifts her nightgown to see how it has happened and her slit has turned into a gash, a wound, writhing with little worms, lifting their heads from their formless bodies up and falling back into the mass again, white, pinkish, lifting up and falling, lifting up and falling, connected to the wound.\r\n</p>\r\n</i>\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>~</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cLie down with me. I need you right now.\u201d \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d she protests. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut she is already in the wrong\u2014she shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place. And what have they been doing? Writing exercises. She hasn\u2019t felt so good in a long time. They had crossed each other on the street; he had begun talking to her, honestly, desperately. He\u2019d put the joint in her hand, the pen, supplied the paper. \u201cLet\u2019s do an exercise,\u201d he\u2019d said. And surely there was no harm in that\u2014she couldn\u2019t run from paper, unwritten words\u2014by now they were under the dim light of his room: a mattress stained with rings of cum, towers of books, butts and ash ground in to a beige rug, and Dylan posters, to remind us that there were heroes, if we chose to face them.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHe has her read what she writes out loud. He applauds her every word. She writes a scene about him and Simone, and how they disgust her. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd now, again. \u201cCome here. Lie with me.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSo surely she is stuck. That she had written with him was certainly more hurtful to Simone\u2014and if she refused then he would get pissed, and tell Simone\u2014and besides, where else would she go\u2014it was too late to go home\u2014\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u201cFine. But no kissing.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t\u201cI promise.\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tShe crawls under the sheets and he sticks his fingers up her cunt. <i>I\u2019m just playing, I\u2019m just playing,</i> he is cooing. \r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBefore you tell me that she should have run let me tell you how it felt. She should not have been there in the first place. Writing with him was worse than this. She could not help that he stuck his hand in her. Now, what was she to do? Was she to run home, where Simone would be? And what she have told Simone? And if she had said nothing? She couldn\u2019t trust Noah. And if she had complained? She would sound unreal, lame, and he is <i>just playing, just playing\u2026</i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t He continues to talk in his soothing voice, to talk as if she were the crazy one, for taking this play so seriously. He continues to whisper about the hypocrisy that surrounds him, to tell her that she understands, that she will treat him with passion. She mutters a complaint\u2014laughable. \u201cYou think she gives a damn about you? All this talk about friendship. Haven\u2019t you learned anything yet\u2014only as creators can we destroy!\u201d\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAnd perhaps, when he sticks himself in her, she tells him not to do that. But she knows, if she did, what his answer will be. She knows what his answer will be and anyhow she had already nodded her agreement that she understood what hypocrisy is and <i>I was on his side and anyhow I had nowhere to go, where would I go, who would I tell, he was my only ally in this, we were allies in this, our secret, our understanding. And once his goblinish nails were scratching inside me there was no point in not kissing because the next step was already taken and if left at that then it would have been cheap. </i>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><i>\r\n\t But if we put our mouths together than we could close off the lies our mouths kept spewing and he kept cooing</i> just playing, just playing. <i>Because even he too couldn\u2019t help but speak lies because that was what our mouths were made for. This wasn\u2019t just playing, but he couldn\u2019t stop, so I had to make him stop. And anyhow it all seemed that it had been decided already for I had nothing else to do but what I did. I kissed him, and it was lame and worn and passed already.</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>TRANSCENDENCE. <i>Hymn to the Moirae.</i> </h6>\r\n\t\r\n<p>\r\nHear your prayer.\t\r\n<blockquote>\r\nDaughter of darkling Nyx much named, draw near, infinite Moirae, and listen to my prayer; who is in the heavenly lake, where waters white burst from a fountain hid in depths of night, and through a dark and stony cavern glide, a cave profound, invisible abide; from whence, wide coursing round the boundless earth, your power extends to those of mortal birth; to men with hope elated, trifling, gay, a race presumptuous, born but to decay.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMoira. It meant <i>portion,</i> as in the <i>portion</i> of one\u2019s life: fate. For the triplets <i>Moirae:</i> Clotho, <i>spinner,</i> spinning the thread of life\u2013Lachesis, <i>alotter,</i> taking up the thread against her rod to measure out each mortal\u2019s portion\u2014and Atropos, <i>unturning, the inexorable.</i> With knotted hands she\u2019d pluck the thread and press it into the deep of her scissors splayed, and cut. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSo that explained <i>portion</i>\u2014as if all our lives could be one spun together onto a single spool.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut excuse me if when I learnt<i> portion</i> I thought of food, not spinning. And so I imagined <i>fate</i>--each human life\u2014as a thigh, or a jelly, or a breast, spread out as a portion of the spinsters\u2019 daily bread. Some half-masticated. Crusty. A stench.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor it is inconceivable that the spinsters would have cared much for manners\u2014there was no one else beside them: even the gods reigned below. <i>The gods were moved, but none can break the ancient Sistes\u2019 iron decrees. </i> Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses. </i> And if grooming habits reflect etiquette\u2014they were bearded. Before my grandmother died she grew a little beard. Thick, short hairs\u2014each an inch or two\u2014that curled out, then in. Sparse enough to make my goose bump, full enough to be indescribable as anything but. This is how the Moirae were. Plato describes them as <i>filleted heads. </i> The first blueprints that my mind drew up were gentler than reality. I imagined old woman bodies with fish heads for heads. In truth, filleted is boneless, or a loop of fibers\u2013these women had no faces.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere are accounts of the Moirae visiting mothers-to-be at the hearth. For instance, as Thestias bore Meleager, the Sisters said: \u201cto you, babe newly born, and to this log [there was a burning log] we give the same life-span.\u201d The Sisters vanished and Thestias hid the log. Years later, in fury, Thestias threw the log into the kindling. <i>The log itself groaned, or seemed to groan, as there it lay licked the unwilling flames and burned away. Unknowing absent, Meleager burned, burned with those flames and felt a hidden fire scorching his vitals\u2026The fire, the pains increase, then sink again; both die away together; gradually in the light air his spirit splits away as over the embers spread a veil of grey.</i> (Ovid, <i>Metamorphoses.</i>)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThese words are beautiful but the one I prefer concerns the birth of Hercules. Hera, old, yellowing at the thought, approaches the Sisters on both knees. Gets them to keep Alcmene stuck in labor. But Alcmene\u2019s pal, sweet loyal Galinthias, fearing that Alcmene, unable to bear the pangs, will grow mad, tricks the Moirae to let go their grip.  They do and the child is born. The Sisters punish her. Ovid puts it delicately: the Moirae turn Galinthias into a weasel and give her a \u201cgrotesque\u201d form of mating: \u201cshe is mounted through the ears and gives birth by bringing forth her young through her throat.\u201d Slippery. I was sick when I read that first and felt the sensation like a marble, propelled from my swallow and pressing and cutting out into the dry air. The second part did not come as clearly and it took me a while to get it, but when I did, in the violet shadows of the bedroom\u2014 a presence, like a bogey, pressing into the drum of my ear. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tI have been listening for signs and all there is is silence. I have a confession. When I am riding in the car there is a recurrence. That we get in an accident, and my skull is being crushed against the sidewalk. I\u2019ll be riding and I can\u2019t stop feeling this feeling of my skull shattering. I feel the top part, the temples and the divot above atlas, hitting the hard concrete. I\u2019ll think about the air rushing, tickling around inside my head, thousands of minute scatterings of bone.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut when I close my eyes\u2014there is a man, standing on a beam high, high up in the air. Below him a body of water is rushing. The man, erect, has his arms pressed to his sides, his feet together. There is a rope tied from the beam to his ankles. He falls. Stick straight. Like diving, except with arms still pressed together. He doesn\u2019t change his position. He falls, down, down, until the rope catches, he dangles, flannel in the blue air, still perfectly still, just a few feet\u2014what, six feet, seven yards\u2014from his blue death. It is this, over and over and over again.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFate. That is why I did it. Before the effect one believes in different causes than one does after the effect. That\u2019s what Nietzsche said. So I should resist the temptation to explain why Em did it: truth lies on a continuum and to pluck out some pulpy hairs and dangle them as reasons would be to misguide. But listen to this:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\tYet I am indeed already there in the future; it is for the sake of that being which I will be there at the turning of the path that I now exert all my strength, and in this sense there is already a relation between my future being and my present being. But a nothingness has slipped into the heart of this relation I <i>am</i> not the self which I will be.. Yet as I am already what I will be (otherwise I would not be interested in any one being more than another), <i>I am not the self which I will be, in the mode of not being it.</i> It is through my horror that I am carried toward the future\u2026 Anguish is precisely my consciousness of being my own future, in the mode of not being. The freedom which reveals itself to us in anguish can be characterized by the existence of that <i>nothing</i> which insinuates itself between motives and act. It is not <i>because</i> I am free that my act is not subject to the determination of motives; on the contrary, the structure of motives as ineffective is the condition of my freedom. There is never a motive <i>in</i> consciousness; motives are only <i>for</i> consciousness. It is by nature transcendence in immanence. Anguish as the manifestation of freedom in the face of self means that man is always separated by a nothingness from his essence.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n\tJean-Paul Sartre, <i>Being and Nothingness.</i> So if anguish is consciousness of that odorless, massless freedom which won\u2019t cease rising and which haunts us as the ever present\u2013and if Em could not bear it anymore\u2013if freedom paralyzes, then shouldn\u2019t fate free?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHaven\u2019t you ever fucked up, did something you didn\u2019t mean to do\u2014and then, what do you have to do, you have to keep pushing it, just keep pushing it\u2014just so it doesn\u2019t all become for nothing? All things become as nothing in our hands. Everything repeats\u2014it keeps returning, hitting back, back\u2026 To what? To nothing? So I kept pushing because I wanted something to become of it, because I didn\u2019t want it to have all been for nothing. You know how it continues. Em tells Simone that she and Noah care about each other\u2013Simone is crushed but, seeing that Em won\u2019t back down, eventually tells Em that if she wants to be a writer, she will have to take in all the emotions, including suffering. \u201cSo I will suffer. God, I feel like Jesus Christ.\u201d And another meeting. Simone, clad in a white tunic, her fingertips cradled, forming a cage lain on her lap, tells Em that she will forgive Em some day\u2013not now, she is not strong enough for that\u2013but some day, Simone will forgive and they will be friends again. Em cursed Simone silently on the way out.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n And Noah\u2014even Em must have known how that would go. They sleep together once, he tires of her\u2013but doesn\u2019t care enough about her to make her go away\u2014so she keeps coming back like a sick puppy.  Honestly, I don\u2019t think that I felt one way or the other about it\u2014I didn\u2019t care about him, I didn\u2019t really care at all, but I had to keep telling myself that I cared so much, because if I stopped\u2014if I stopped acting like I cared\u2014then what, what would there be? How would I move? What would there be to move for? So I kept moving. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMaybe that doesn\u2019t sound like fate. It felt like fate, you know, to hear yourself in your head. In those blue hours alone, when everything becomes still, when everything becomes the same, and you hear yourself. You hear yourself articulate what you\u2019re going to do, how you are going to act\u2014and then, it doesn\u2019t matter how you feel about it, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you don\u2019t care or you think it\u2019s bad or you don\u2019t want to, you do it. That is how everything is. That is what I did\u2014I began writing about it, every melodrama that played out\u2014and soon, when we were together, I would hear my voice speaking out my actions, dramatizing them, as I moved. For the first time\u2014I was free to move. When he bashed my character, I wasn\u2019t there\u2014I took it in from the ceiling, wrote it in my pad, and came back the next day for more material. Material wasn\u2019t enough\u2014I began to form it into a story\u2013but of course, I could not get to the end because there is no end.<sup><a name=\"id10\" href=\"#ft10\">10</a></sup>  \r\n\r\n<h6>TRANSCENDENCE. <i>All Things Become as Nothing in Our Hands.</i></h6>\r\n\r\n<p>Em enters the apartment with her head down and her shoulders erect.

In the city\u2019s night sky, the pigeons become silhouettes and the sky is pink and pasted on. Each night the man comes. He goes into the coop, and takes the pigeons one by one out of their cages, holds them by their claws. Hear their wings flap!  Otherwise, or perhaps because of this, the night sounds still. </i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nY: I liked to read about the big things. Metaphysics. I found it eh to read about people. More interesting to read about the big things.<p>\r\n\r\nX: The big things. Like God? It\u2019s not that I wasn\u2019t interested in that\u2013it\u2019s just. I couldn\u2019t see it. What would I be looking at? Don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t believe in the big things. No. I believe. I believe. But what\u2019s the point of reading about the big things? Why are you interested in reading about them? <p>\r\n\r\nY: To get a better understanding of God\u2014<p>\r\n\r\nX: A better understanding. I don\u2019t know. It never worked for me. Reading about the big things never made me see God any more clearly: I\u2019d just see words, descriptions of God. Images. And I know that that\u2019s not it. That seeing is just a first step towards getting closer. Maybe the first step: you start to imagine Him through images. Like a dream. That\u2019s all I can do. I want to get closer to God, too. I want to experience Him. But maybe the best way to do that is by reading ethics, you know? Learning how to turn my soul so that I can then face the Good, or God. If I want to be with God, I\u2019d better learn how to turn my soul. Because it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t believe in God. I\u2019d like to believe that the fact that I don\u2019t experience him at all is a sign that He exists. And that the fact that I\u2019m drawn towards ethics, that I want to turn my soul, is a sign that He exists. Because if He does exist then I certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to see Him now. Not the way I live my life. My soul is turned, I know, away from him. So the fact that I don\u2019t see Him, don\u2019t feel Him\u2013maybe that\u2019s proof that He is there. There are all those metaphors around, in speaking about God\u2013looking, un-looking. Being turned from him, turned around. If God exists then he is very far away from here. Good that I don\u2019t see Him. <p>\r\nY: I like it. I like the way that you describe your God. A distant God. Sounds like Schreber. GOD IS APPROACHING. Schreber would lie terrified in his bed, terrified that God could sniff him out because he was <i>too</i> attractive\u2013that God was going to swoop down from above and snatch him from his hospital bed\u2014<p>\r\nX: Of course! Isn\u2019t it all about approaching, a constant approaching and movement towards and away from God? The Hindus with their shrines. The Christians having God come into the room and they\u2019re eating their bread, imbibing God, trying to get Him inside them. Transubstantiation. What is that. Eating God. <p>\r\nY: Yeah. That\u2019s something I really don\u2019t understand. <p>\r\nX: But anyhow. How else could it be? What else would it mean to believe in God? What do you mean when you told me the other day, that you believe in God now? <p>\r\nY: Well. I feel the presence of God\u2019s love. I feel God\u2019s love. <p>\r\nX: Feel! Love! What is that, feeling His love? What do you mean that you \u201cfeel\u201d it? And what is it, what\u2019s this \u201clove\u201d? What does \u201cfeeling\u201d mean? What does \u201clove\u201d mean? I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t feel it. I don\u2019t feel it or not feel it. I feel the same. I have always felt the same. I don\u2019t know if I feel this way because God is present or not present. How could I know the difference? I like the world. I think it\u2019s a lovely place to be in. I\u2019m happy to be here. Is that a sign of God? What do you mean? What do you mean when you feel like God\u2019s love is always present everywhere? <p>\r\nY: Like when I am feeling down, I feel Him. He is there. When I am feeling happy, He is there. <p>\r\n\r\n[Silence.]\r\n<p>\r\nY: And how do you feel? I mean, what is this world that you live in, this anti-God\u2013I mean, this world without God\u2019s presence. How do you feel?\r\n<p>\r\n\t\tWhat is this world she lives in. How does she feel. Anxiety. Like she can\u2019t escape herself. Like not hearing the question. She thinks of Schreber and his heaven: when you die, all those nerve-souls zapping up into space to form a wall around God. The wall is there to protect the people on earth from having to feel God\u2019s presence. The nerve-souls are turned around, they are facing away from God: they approach God but they never face him, never see Him. She thinks of the Sufis, twirling, twirling so fast because if they twirl fast enough than they can get God inside of them. Ecstasy. The sensation of moist fingers pressing dry bread firmly against a rough and wet tongue. Looking. Un-looking. Plato and his cave. All those metaphors of turning, everywhere you go, it\u2019s all the same: all these metaphors of facing God or not facing God, of being turned, of turning oneself around and around in order for him to approach.\r\n<p>\r\nWords. These words won\u2019t go away. That\u2019s all it comes back to\u2013a conversation about this and all she can think about are some repeating metaphors about gods. Can a metaphor take you there? Maybe she isn\u2019t totally wrong. All these rituals, all this liturgy about turning\u2013they\u2019re all metaphors too, right? Metaphors for approaching God. Metaphors for being unable to approach him. For needing to speak about Him through metaphor. For trying to survive in a world where He is or is not present. All these metaphors of overturning. Where do these metaphors come from? Where were these words born?\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>THE OVERTURNING OF A ROCK.</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nThese potato bugs scatter at\u2014exposed to their first sunlight, with shells weak, moist, dusky, and legs, if you can call them legs, sinking as they try to escape the sun, shamed, running roundly within the circumference of a shadow intaglioed into the floor, the shape of their world\u2014the overturning of a rock.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h4>PART ONE,  ATTACHMENT<sup><a name=\"id14\" href=\"#ft14\">14</a></sup>   (The Beginning.

Judgment Day came and went: a lone man crusade visited NYC, plastering signs about the imminent end (May 21, 2011, to be precise) throughout the city\u2019s buses and subways and telephone booths. \u2018Round midnight of the end, I went to the store for a handle of Jack. A feeling of jubilation permeated the air\u2013normally, I\u2019d keep my eyes peeled as I walked through Bed-Stuy, aware of my position as an unwelcome gentrifier. But the common enemy forges unexpected alliances, and hesitant laughs. <i>The world didn\u2019t answer, so let\u2019s get twisted,</i> a Puerto Rican grinned at me as I slid my twenty beneath bullet-proof glass.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<i>The world didn\u2019t answer, so let\u2019s get twisted.</i> So Judgment Day came and went, as did my brief delusions of camaraderie with the block; but the outdated advertisements remained, as did the birds. Sometimes they looked like condoms. Sometimes they were condoms. Barely un-embryonic, still translucent flesh\u2013the only way to be certain was to bend over each form, and to examine it for signs of life: black dot for an eye, faint outline of a beak, crushed feet. I remember bending: bending to study at least six distinct corpses in the distance from my house to yours; bending to snap granular cell-phone proof as a Hassidic woman and her retarded son, still dressed up for God, scurried past.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAt what point can we give up?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h6>IT\u2019S HERE, NOW.

She watched his insides spasm, the rippling of his sleek brown coat, silent gasps as he hacked up masticated doggie treats onto the concrete. Around his neck, a slack red leash. At the other end, his owner: bony wrist attached to a bony body, well-groomed in her Sunday casual (not much: it is a preternaturally warm day for October); she was chatting with a friend, sitting on a bench, oblivious to his pain. He was turned away from her, as if in politeness, as he hacked in pain.\r\n<p>\r\nWhen she picked him up, his body was still spasming: a ripple down the length of his exposed butt hole to his skull. She cupped a hand beneath his hard belly, oblivious to his pain, not even looking at him; somehow ignoring the shaking heart beat that her hand must feel. She dropped him in his carrier, a red mesh bag, pushed down on his spine as he continued to hover and tremble and hack up again; forcing him to lower himself mid-hack as the sound of the zip\u2013right above his head, pressing upon those perked up ears\u2013this red world closes in on him.\r\n<p>\r\nTo imagine being in that little mesh cage, no space to even vomit, vomiting on top of his paws\u2013the sound of the zipper and crinkly mesh and this red world enclosing in on you\u2026 \r\n<p>\r\n<h6>The Thrill of the Ordinary</h6>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m learning to appreciate that everything is good in its own way,\u201d Bruise tells me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be super intelligent or whatever, or, everything is intelligent in its own way.\u201d\r\n<p>\r\n<h6>Good Advice from Bruise</h6>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\u201cSpend the next five years of your life as if they don\u2019t matter.

Yes: LOVE. O History, I know that you\u2019re pissed at me now because you think that I have abandoned our book-ridden apartment to drive to The Heartland to abandon the quest for Truth in order to run away from my suffering and pursue LOVE <i>over</i> Truth. But History, what if the Truth IS Love? O History, listen:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\n\t\t\tThe ten thousand Dharmas return to the One.<br/>\r\n\t\t\tWhere does the One return?\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<i>Return:</i> that is the <i>key</i> verb.

What if (and it <i>is,</i> it <i>is</i>) the Truth is just this: everything is always changing, changing, changing because you are attached to form; but if you could just still your mind then you would understand\u2013in the words of The Great Zen Master Seung Sahn, that <i>universal substance is never changing\u2026 If [you] are attached to name and form, then everything is always changing, changing, changing. [You] can see how this view makes everything: time and space, cause and effect, name and form. That just comes from [your] thinking mind! Now that [you] see this mind is completely empty, this world is empty, everything is empty!</i> And once you understand THIS (Truth), then you would see that <i>moment world is truth, because in one moment, everything is already complete. Form is form; emptiness is emptiness. Mountain is mountain, and water is water. This truth. <u>But here is a very, very important point: in itself, truth has no function.</u></i> IN ITSELF, TRUTH HAS NO FUNCTION! Where does the One<i> return,</i> History? The One returns to THE EVERYDAY WORLD, with all its forms and names, because we\u2019re stuck with our thinking mind. Now that we know that, we\u2019ve got to think about what we will <i>do</i> with our enlightenment\u2014yer <i>stuck</i> in truth, it\u2019s a matter of how you <i>deal</i> with it\u2014and you deal with it through LOVE, compassion. O History, I confess, I don\u2019t know how knowing that all is One generates LOVE (I\u2019m beginning to believe, History, that there\u2019s got to be an outside force\u2014that if Christ is Love then Christ <i>is</i> Our Savior but I\u2019ll let that point pass): the <i>point</i> is that LOVE saves us. I am going to die! You are going to die!  Everyone, everything that we know is going to die! The world is going to end! Everyone has always known that instinctually, whether yer Buddha or not. So why don\u2019t we all kill ourselves: how do we all continue to <i>survive?

So, a few days earlier, BRUISE asked if her commune friend NIGH (hippie-name unchanged) could crash at The Author\u2019s apartment. NIGH is some kid from Nebraska who, like BRUISE, has been bumming around the USA and all its communes for the past couple of months. I said yes, and NIGH and I spent one night together and really hit it off. Really hit it off: what I mean to say is that sometimes, you meet somebody, and its like they light up yer whole soul and take you back to a part of yerself that you thought was dead in you, maybe you might\u2019ve been right with yer instincts, where you were before you started going anywhere (The Buddha says: \u201cAll things are already enlightened.\u201d), but you think that that\u2019s, that\u2019s gone for me, I\u2019ve learned too much, these insects have infested far too deep\u2026 But HISTORY said maybe I should revisit what I knew before, and let me tell you, one night with NIGH was like that lamp, that old eternal lamp. But then that lamp had to drive away in the morn for a doctor\u2019s appointment back in The Heartland (he had a blood clot\u2013not a big deal as of <i>yet</i>). Anyhow, BRUISE and I talked the day after, and she said that she was driving up to Lincoln to pursue blood\u2013and I went with her. Got up and left, with just one change of clothes and a notebook.

He\u2019s getting pissed: he\u2019s telling me that I should <i>Stop Calling Them BOOKS!

            "rendered_content": "<p>The fall 2011 edition of Dissent magazine brings us the latest in a long, storied line of complaints from the gatekeepers of critical taste. Author Charles Taylor <a href=\"http://www.dissentmagazine.org/article/?article=4059\">writes</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I\u2019ve been a film critic on and off for twenty-five years and have been lucky enough to take part in the tail end of the best era of print film criticism and the beginning of the Internet, when it seemed like the Web would be the new delivery system for the kind of writing that was starting to be imperiled in print. My experience tells me that not only was film criticism in better shape in the print era, but good work stood a greater chance of making an impact. Only a fool would say that there\u2019s not good work being done on the Internet. But the nature of the medium, the way it has reshaped journalism and public discourse, makes it harder for that work to matter. In its contribution to the ongoing disposability of our cultural, political, and social life, in encouraging the cultural segregation that currently disfigures democracy, the Internet has to bear a great deal of responsibility for the present derangement of American life.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Now to be sure, the ability to close off any kind of opposing viewpoint is almost certainly a factor in the increasingly bitter political divide that threatens to rip the country apart. But it\u2019s hard to argue that if the majority of people prefer <i>The Green Lantern</i> or <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> to <i>The King\u2019s Speech</i>\u2014to use some of his own examples\u2014that this somehow represents the defeat of democracy. After all, the internet makes possible the dissemination of movie information far beyond what was possible in the print era; granting instant access to, not just established publications, but countless blogs and websites as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taylor, however, is not convinced. He complains that many of these new writers lack sufficient rigor, or boast exclusionary writing styles; worse, they are helping to create an unwieldy volume of criticism, which serves to drown out critical voice, allowing a deluge of publicity-driven lowest-common-denominator fare to overwhelm the market. From all this, he foresees \u201cthe probable death of movies as popular art, and the retreat of serious critics into contemplation cells.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is an ominous prediction, but fortunately, Taylor is only half right. For the internet will not result in the death of movies as popular art. It is, however, bringing about the death of the professional critic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cThere is currently no must-read critic,\u201d Taylor laments. \u201cNo Pauline Kael or Andrew Sarris whose opinion can kick off a conversation or an argument\u2026Part of the problem is the thing often cited to prove the strength of film criticism: the sheer number of people online who are doing it.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea that the lack of a dominant critical force leads to a decline in the art form being criticized is not a new one. Ten years ago, in a now-famous Atlantic piece, B. R. Myers wrote:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The absence of a dominant school of criticism, we are told, has given rise to an extraordinary variety of styles, a smorgasbord with something for every palate\u2026From a reader's standpoint, however, \u201cvariety\u201d is the last word that comes to mind, and more appears to be \u201cout\u201d than ever before.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>He then went on to explain how insightful, well-written prose has all but disappeared from the contemporary literary scene, from Annie Proulx to Cormac McCarthy, Don DeLillo and virtually every other highly-acclaimed writer of the last thirty years. In the absence of some overarching high-culture tastemaker, it seems writers have devolved into \u201ca remarkably crude form of affectation: a prose so repetitive, so elementary in its syntax, and so numbing in its overuse of wordplay that it often demands less concentration than the average \u2018genre\u2019 novel.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myers believed the current critical establishment was partly to blame. \u201cThe critics\u2019 admiration\u2026reflects a growing consensus that the best prose is that which yields the greatest number of standout sentences, regardless of whether or not they fit the context,\u201d he decried. Regarding Delillo\u2019s <i>White Noise</i>, he writes: \u201cThe novel\u2019s inflated reputation remains a clear signal that we should expect less from contemporary fiction than from books written in our grandparents' day.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Myers doesn\u2019t state it explicitly, but from his initial stab concerning \u201cthe absence of a dominant school of criticism,\u201d it seems he views the decline of literature as a consequence of the decline of literary criticism, as though writers\u2019 artistic standards have deteriorated without the guidance of a higher school of critical thought. Critics, meanwhile, are either making the best of a bad situation, or have let their standards decline along with the material they\u2019re reporting on. Neither explanation speaks well of the critic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In predicting \u201cthe death of movies as popular art,\u201d Taylor seems to believe a similar outcome is taking place in the world of film. Unlike Myers, however, he traces the source of the trouble to the advent of the internet. In doing so, he throws his hat in with other internet decriers like Andrew Keen and Jaron Lanier, two critics Rob Horning analyzed <a href=\"http://thenewinquiry.com/post/13786656384/the-trouble-with-digital-conservatism\">recently over at The New Inquiry</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lanier\u2014author of <i>You Are Not A Gadget</i>, a book that Taylor describes as \u201cessential\u201d\u2014argues that the internet alters and ultimately limits the possibilities not only of cultural creation, but of existence in general. Taylor explicitly turns to him to bolster his thesis that the internet is destroying democracy, citing the effects of anonymous commenting, which has supposedly wrecked our ability to communicate with people who disagree with us. Horning\u2019s critique, however, illuminates another similarity between the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cLanier\u2026regards genuine artists as entrepreneurs first and foremost; those who are not motivated by profit are dilettantes whose work is inherently bad,\u201d Horning writes. Therefore, \u201cWeb 2.0 voluntarism\u2026is an inauthentic form of expression, for in order to be authentic, it must have an unambiguous value assigned to it by the market, the proxy for real social recognition under capitalism.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is probably no coincidence that Taylor avoids this bit of Lanier\u2019s theory. Lanier himself doesn\u2019t seem to shy away from equating value with market valuation\u2014he\u2019s quoted more or less praising a system in which \u201ceveryone would have easy access to everyone else\u2019s creative bits at reasonable prices\u2026[an] arrangement [which] would celebrate personhood in full, because personal expression would be valued\u201d\u2014but for Taylor to plaintively argue that bloggers are bad because they do what he does for free would be more than a little crass. So instead we get subjective critiques about the quality of their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cTheir film knowledge is broad and deep, but they wear that knowledge lightly,\u201d he complains. \u201cTo read them is to read people grounded in the sensual response to movies.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cthe ones who have reacted against the shallowness of the current conversation [write]\u2026articles that analyze sequences in terms of lighting and editing\u2026presented with the deadly seriousness of a doctoral dissertation.\u201d In other words, the bloggers are either too shallow, or too serious, or too boring\u2026the list goes on. The true division between their works and his, however, is that he is paid and they, mostly, are not. Their shortcomings are not justification for this, but rather, vice-versa; his reasoning emerges from the vantage point of his position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his defense, Taylor doesn\u2019t harp on the fact that he is \u201cbetter\u201d than the other writers (though it is certainly implied). Rather, he thinks the internet in itself is making it worse for all of them\u2014for film criticism as a whole. One way it is doing so is through the taint of commercial interest. For critics\u2019 jobs, he argues,</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>depend on securing advertiser-pleasing hits by lavishing coverage on the worst of what\u2019s out there, especially the superhero and fantasy movies. Editors hope to attract hits by feeding into a movie\u2019s prerelease hoopla. What a critic actually thinks about the movie is often drowned in the ongoing publicity deluge\u2026Editors then point to the number of hits generated by this as proof that what the readers really want is coverage of the big movies\u2014whether or not there\u2019s been coverage of anything else to choose from.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not an ill-founded complaint, and it applies to criticism of other media as well. As a former Pitchfork music magazine contributor, I found it surprisingly difficult to convince a certain then-editor-in-chief to cover music outside already-established \u201cindie-popular\u201d genres and artists. Headline review space, meanwhile, would be given over to panning the latest offering from Asher Roth or some other flash-in-the-pan commercial success, at the expense of listen-worthy smaller artists. There can be little doubt that business-minded thinking played a role in such decisions. After all, why take the time to ridicule something\u2014especially something that is more or less a bad novelty gag\u2014if it\u2019s not just to garner page clicks?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not a new phenomenon, however, and it is not a byproduct of the internet era. After all, print publications were hamstrung by advertisers, too. Page count is a direct reflection of advertising sales. The gratuitous top five lists that Taylor bemoans existed then, as now. Furthermore, the gradual symbiosis between criticism and publicity is a hallmark, not of the internet age, but of capitalism itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, those searching for new, unheard music end up turning elsewhere. Does anyone look to Rolling Stone to discover new music anymore? In the future, will they still read Pitchfork? In a nod to the growing number of listeners looking outside the critic-approved/commercially-acceptable sphere of musical offerings, the latter unveiled \u201cAltered Zones,\u201d an amalgam of popular blog-writers covering less commercial music for a single Pitchfork-affiliated website, shortly after my departure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a move, however, is little more than the critics\u2019 attempt to decelerate their own obsolescence. After all, if you can\u2019t compete with blog writers, you might as well co-opt them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<center>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</center>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all his supposed concern about the death of democracy, Taylor is still, most importantly, a film critic, and it is his prediction regarding \u201cthe death of movies as popular art\u201d that I am most concerned with. After all, it would certainly be a bad thing if the loss of critical authority resulted in a decline in the quality of film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, for those of us who aren\u2019t writing professional criticism\u2014and especially from the perspective of young filmmakers\u2014the outlook should not seem so dour. First of all, there is the obvious fact that there have been, and always will be, certain people inclined to seek out entertainment more intellectually stimulating than the typical mass-market fare. A desire to seek out the new, either as spectator or creator: this is essentially how \u201cart\u201d evolves in the first place. If Taylor is lamenting that he may no longer have a role in helping inform the populace of such works, then he should be relieved to know that, with the advent of the internet, such information is pretty easily available to anyone who wishes to find it; and unlike in the world of politics, where the echo chamber of the internet leads to closed-mindedness that has direct consequences on our ability to govern, there are no entrenched partisan perspectives instilled in the average filmgoer. If anything, he may be a bit lazy, and turn to commercial fare as a default, but there is no reason to suspect that, when faced with an array of critical reviews and informative movie capsules, he will angrily turn his head from any he\u2019s not seen a commercial for. Anyone looking to watch a movie is already seeking out information. Taylor derides \u201cthe attempts of Amazon and Netflix to steer your next purchase based on what you\u2019ve already bought,\u201d but even this leads to the broadening of a customer\u2019s cultural palette, and perhaps in ways that the only half-heartedly engaged\u2014those most influenced by the random grab-bag of newspaper reviews anyway\u2014wouldn\u2019t have bothered to seek out in the first place. And for those who aren\u2019t looking to read film criticism\u2014which, in any era, will be a significant portion of the population\u2014then the loss of the critic\u2019s voice is essentially meaningless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meaninglessness seems to be the true crux of Taylor\u2019s complaint. \u201cThere are too many critics writing too many pieces,\u201d he writes, referring no doubt to the growing coterie of bloggers who\u2019ve taken to doing his job pro bono across the web. Perhaps sensing the weakness of his earlier criticism, he dons a new tack, arguing that, other than being \u201csensuous\u201d and intellectually lightweight, the blog world speaks to itself and itself alone, closing off entry to those \u201cnot already novitiates in the order of cinema.\u201d \u201cAll the serious young cinematic men sound as if they\u2019re writing for each other,\u201d he argues. \u201cNot showing off, but sealed off.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is some merit to these remarks. The internet does have a way of creating isolated, clique-like atmospheres which can distort perception of the world at large. Take, for example, the hilarious rantings of Psychedelic Horseshit frontman Matt Whitehurst, published\u2014shockingly, though this was the time when all the major newspapers were getting wet over \u201cthe next coming of rock\u201d\u2014in a 2009 edition of the Washington Post. \u201cTerminal Boredom is the new Rolling Stone,\u201d he raved. \u201cThe bigger heads on Terminal Boredom are ruining music today.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don\u2019t know what Terminal Boredom is? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To those enveloped in the culture, however, such claims appear as truths. Certain websites take on the cachet of the old cultural trendsetters at large. And you can find one for every possible taste or style. Thus, a hegemonic consensus among the greater populace becomes increasingly difficult. In this way, Taylor is not completely off the mark concerning the increasing inability of any one critic to have any kind of sway in the cacophonous din of voices echoing around the internet. To some extent, our ears <i>do</i> close off to those we don\u2019t agree with, and we take comfort in like-minded communities where we can elect our own tastemakers and come to our own opinions regarding the values of certain artists, be they writers, musicians, filmmakers, or whoever else catches your fancy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This doesn\u2019t necessarily bode ill for the world of film, though. This is because, no matter how novice-friendly online critics tend (or tend not) to be, the fact remains that, for those who wish to know, such access remains at their fingertips. You can catch up to speed with anything unfamiliar; with music, literature, and now movies as well, access to the works themselves is pretty much a click away. You can find whatever you want, and you can find out more about it from a vast array of sources. With profoundly easier access to a greater variety of work, the influx of cultural consumption has subsequently increased. This is not bad for the filmmaker. It does, however, decrease the importance of the critic, whose job has been traditionally to help steer time- and money-pressed consumers towards what they deemed were the most worthy endeavors. With the advent of the internet, the middleman is less and less needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With improving knowledge, it becomes easier for consumers to become tastemakers themselves. Natural impulses to share information and discuss it can find expression in community outlets at websites such as the aforementioned Terminal Boredom. As such, taste begins to emerge organically\u2014making its way from a few blog writers simply espousing their opinions, gathering steam through online forum discussions, and eventually reaching wider audiences, at which point it gets picked up on by mass media outlets like the New York Times or the Washington Post (which is no doubt how Psychedelic Horseshit made it into such a publication in the first place). To claim such processes are anti-democratic is to claim that black is white\u2014but then, that\u2019s not Taylor\u2019s actual complaint. The critic is no longer needed to \u201cdiscover\u201d music (or art, or film). Rather than helping bestow attention and critical merit on selected artists, his role has evolved to become little more than a lagging indicator of popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a role\u2014and I imagine this gets to the heart of Taylor\u2019s fears about \u201cthe death of movies as popular art\u201d\u2014is not without importance. And as far as film goes, it is especially relevant, for such indication helps direct the most important thing of all: money. For musicians and novelists, a bit of money helps, but is often unnecessary; it\u2019s nice when artists can quit their day jobs and work on their craft full time, but you can play in a band on weekends or write your novel after work. The startup costs are generally quite low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For film, this is not the case. Even notoriously low-budget films like <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> or Kevin Smith\u2019s original <i>Clerks</i> cost $22,000 and $27,000 to make, respectively. The world of film has always been prohibitive to the DIY kind of ethos that you can find in the worlds of music and print. Therefore, popularity must play a bigger role in its creation, and in this light, the critic\u2019s role can be seen as almost noble, aiming to cultivate the tastes of those who might otherwise be disinclined to watch the films that the critic cares about. She implicitly needs mass recognition of her favorite films to help insure future financing is available for other like-minded filmmakers and projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even assuming such ideal intentions, however, Taylor\u2019s criticism falls flat. This is because the power of the internet overcompensates for the potential loss of the critic\u2019s sway in guiding accolades\u2014and with it, popularity and financing\u2014the filmmaker\u2019s way. Take, for example, the movie <i>Paranormal Activity</i>. Created for \u201conly\u201d $15,000, the movie debuted on September 25, 2009, in a mere 13 towns across the U.S. However, director Oren Peli turned to the web to get viewers to vote where he should take the movie next. This helped create buzz, and allowed him to roll out the film\u2019s release in the most effective (and lucrative) way possible. By November it was showing worldwide, and it later went on to gross nearly $200 million. It also should be noted that the film has a favorability rating of 92% among Top Critics at RottenTomatoes.com\u2014though, considering most are dated December 2009 or later, it seems they came after the initial internet success, further demonstrating that, at best, the critic seems to be performing the role of redundant identifier. This is not to say that critically acclaimed and crowd-pleasing movies should be one and the same; but if a film is truly merit-worthy, surely there will be enough like-minded individuals tied together across the internet to give it the attention it deserves. No critic is an island; now less so than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is especially true when you stop to think that, not only has the internet changed our modes of viewership, but our ability to create as well. The music world has seen the rise of low-budget, DIY artists since the birth of punk in the \u201870s (which is to say nothing of the Hasil Adkinses in the world before then), and zine culture and other low-cost printing has ensured that writers who wanted to express themselves without going through the typical channels had avenues in which to do so. But advanced technology and the advent of the internet have made it easier than ever to not just create, but reach an audience as well. Regarding writing, this is clear enough; for musicians, Myspace, SoundCloud, and other music hosting websites have become essential. In less obvious ways, too, the internet has been beneficial. Amazon.com, for instance, has begun publishing authors, allowing them to eschew traditional publishing houses whose editors have typically held the keys to the first gates of critical acceptance. Magazines such as this one exist solely on the internet. Even TV shows are being produced now with the internet in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some may argue that, in light of such influx, it\u2019s harder than ever to sort the wheat from the chaff. This may be true\u2014and with the death of the critic, it becomes especially so (after all, it used to be a paying gig). However, the creation and consumption of art will not fade with the dissolution of the critic\u2019s voice. Neither will our taste buds collectively shrivel and rot. Those seeking to push boundaries will continue to do so; the cognoscenti will continue to seek out thought-provoking means of entertainment, and the ignoscenti will continue to watch lions maul each other and CGI robots explode. Some, meanwhile, argue that the internet creates a culture of instant obsolescence, and the dissolution of consensual critical authority will only accelerate this trend. This adds to a sense of disposability that is attributed to much artistic work today. Such arguments, however, underestimate the power of consensus to emerge through online communities. Furthermore, just because the internet provides an open market for opinion doesn't mean that all opinions will be valued equally: the internet may be democratic, but by sheer self-segregation, those with like-minded tastes and interests will congregate, further inspiring those among them to create. This kind of passion is absent from the souls of casual moviegoers, who don\u2019t spend their time arguing minute details in forums or on blogs. To the extent that Taylor complains that such discourse is a closed circuit, he\u2019s right\u2014but not because nobody is free to enter into it if they so choose. It is from these communities that the artists of tomorrow will emerge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There can be no serious doubt that art will continue to prosper into the future, across all media. It has survived the shift from patronage-based monarchical society to market-based capitalist society; it has survived the advent of mass-media; it will survive the internet age. If anything, the dissolution of critical authority and the decay of the canonization process brings with it increased possibility from the perspective of the artist. The internet allows for dissemination of information and expression unlike anything that has come before. This is not an unequivocally positive development. As a journalist, I confess that I, too, have often decried the devastation the internet has wreaked upon my employment possibilities. But as an artist, I find that the possibilities seem more limitless than ever. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",

            "rendered_content": "<p>If you are not yet acquainted with the world of street style blogs, please, allow me to introduce you to a new and excellent way to spend time on the internet.  Street style blogs are daily websites run by professional, semi-professional, and amateur photographers who prowl the streets looking for well- or perhaps only unusually-dressed people to photograph.  The purpose, from the point of view of a blog reader, is to see what a bunch of strangers are wearing on any given day. Over the past five or six years such blogs have become hugely popular, and, if their godfather is <a href=\"http://www.zeitgeistfilms.com/billcunninghamnewyork/trailer.html\">Bill Cunningham from the New York Times</a>, their king is Scott Schuman, <a href=\"http://www.thesartorialist.com\">the Sartorialist</a>. Schuman has been blogging since 2005 and has published a book of his street style photographs, mounted several gallery shows, and shot numerous advertising campaigns and editorials.  I was introduced to his blog in 2007 by a friend\u2014a designer and seamstress, she once greeted me with an ecstatic cry, \u201cYour blouse has cloth-covered buttons!  That\u2019s amazing!\u201d In addition to teaching me what a cloth-covered button is, she sent me a link to the Sartorialist.  \u201cYou\u2019ll love this,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, and interesting.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As someone who has since viewed every one of Schuman\u2019s photographs at the Sartorialist in a methodical, some might say obsessive, sweep through his entire archives, I am in a position to affirm that photographs of other people\u2019s outfits are, in fact, interesting. In fact, utterly fascinating. Some of the fascination is purely escapist, some aesthetic; Schuman composes beautiful photographs of (mostly) beautiful people, perched or lounging in far-away locales. To the extent that escapism and aestheticism predominate, we might group these photographs with other images through which the fashion industry usually markets itself in ad campaigns and magazine editorials. Such images accentuate what is otherworldly about fashion\u2014its sumptuous materials, its daring shapes and brilliant colors, its costliness\u2014and make it adorn extraordinary bodies in extraordinary places. The implicit message is that such fantasy is fashion\u2019s natural habitat, and that the ordinary, the everyday, what we naively call \u201cthe real world,\u201d is not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sartorialist sometimes plays to this point of view, as I have said.  Schuman\u2019s lionization of a certain monied, cosmopolitan leisure can be rather distasteful. But when the Sartorialist is at his best, he captures subjects who have somehow made style genuinely relevant to the ordinary world. In such portraits, Schuman presents fashion not as an escape from life, but as a costume for life. His best photographs show people engaged in some bit of private business, in which their style seems somehow to heighten their activity. To my eye, these images posit something rather splendid about the relationship between what we wear and what we do, between bodies and the world they inhabit.  Clothing here is not merely aesthetic, as if the body were but an object to be artfully arraigned and then paraded through the streets.  Nor is it rightly considered an exercise in self-expression, an external broadcast of the inward, unique soul. It is, instead, a way of characterizing what we are actually doing with ourselves, with our physical, dynamic presence in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we had better descend to the level of concrete examples.  Consider, to start, one such character, <a href=\"http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/on-the-street-the-house-painter-savannah-georgia/\">a house painter</a>. Painters of all kinds are a favorite subject with Schuman, and some of his finest photographs are of men and women in drab, bespattered clothing. But each of these compositions suggests something different about the labor in question. This painter seems like a craftsman, disciplined (see his broad, brown belt and thick key fob, his tools about his feet, the brush held so surely) and proud (the traditional head-to-toe white, topped with the still-clean cap and a watchful gaze). <a href=\"http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/at-calvin-klein-milan/\">Another house painter</a> suggests something more spontaneous, or sly: his light-blue shirt is a subtle riff on the all-white uniform, and his fanciful kerchief, multi-tiered fanny pack, and squinting smile seem both fanciful and self-contained. <a href=\"http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/on-the-street-the-painter-as-in-stage-sets-nyc/\">A third painter</a>, this time \u201cas in stage sets,\u201d dresses in and against character. The profession is traditionally male, and her outfit blends androgynous elements\u2014her fantastic haircut, the contrast of her rough painter\u2019s pants and holster with bare skin.  Her  necklace and her gloves, at once ladylike and workmanlike, seem irreverent: the job requires her to cover her hands, but damned if she\u2019ll take off her jewelry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love how each of these portraits depicts the relationship between the painter and his or her tools. The first painter arrays his tools on the ground at his feet, and keeps only one brush at hand; he seems to take an expansive and deliberate approach.  The third painter carries her brushes in a holster, like a weapon; she appears compact and mobile.  Meanwhile what of that fanny pack?  Plenty of people wear fanny packs as a statement of style.  But what makes the second picture so potent is that the painter\u2019s fanny pack is a statement of utility, too.  He works outside, with his hands; he could bring a bag or a satchel to the worksite\u2014perhaps he does\u2014but there are some number of things he wants to have on his person, some instinct for tidiness, closeness, self-possession, and so he wears a fanny pack. (Schuman encountered the same painter a year later, and he was wearing a dark blue sweatshirt and a neon orange fanny pack.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps these are differences of expedience, or of personality.  But the premise of the Sartorialist, and I think its primary insight, is that these are also differences of style. A key fob, a holster, and a fanny pack are all choices of style, whether conceived strictly in fashion or not.  They are style in the sense that they equip the body not to paint, but to paint with a particular spirit. The style of these figures has to do not just with <i>who they are</i>, nor with <i>what they do</i>, but with some collision between the two. This, I think, is the thing to look for from street style.  In what wide-ranging spirit can the business of daily life be conducted? What can painting be like?  What can working be like?  What can walking be like?  Or waiting? Ask yourselves these questions as you look through Schuman\u2019s archives. <a href=\"http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/on-the-street-left-bank-paris-14/\">Waiting</a> can be like a coiled spring: contradictions collected and vitality stilled. It can be like <a href=\"http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/on-the-street-via-fogazzaro-milan-3/\">dreaming</a> or like <a href=\"http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/on-the-street-composition-in-red-milano/\">displacement</a>, or like sure-faced <a href=\"http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/deep-style/\">concealment</a>. <a href=\"http://www.thesartorialist.com/photos/on-the-street-aurora-milano/\">Walking</a> can be like inscrutable self-possession, solitariness, free passage. What a thing to slip both hands in your pockets, shoulders sloping and elbows loose behind you.  There is no better way to stroll. <img src=\"/media/end.gif\"></p>",
